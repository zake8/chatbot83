The texts present catalogs of 3D artworks, primarily sculptures and ceramics, created by various artists over several decades. They explore the artists' creative processes, materials, techniques, and influences, including wood, clay, plaster, bronze, negative spaces, topological structures, and historical sculptures. The authors discuss the importance of 3D forms, visual perception, touch, and the human body, emphasizing the role of sculpture in creating unique and unrepeated appearances. The texts also highlight the relationship between the artist's inquiry and the successive revelations of their artworks, as well as the dynamic between revealing and concealing in sculpture.

...theories of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). It discusses the importance of theory in defining and countering misunderstandings about CSCL, which is a pedagogical vision of collaborative learning influenced by contemporary philosophical approaches and theories. The authors categorize relevant theories into subjective, intersubjective, and inter-objective, and highlight the role of technology, practices, and research methods in shaping CSCL theories. The chapter also discusses the emerging ecology of socio-digital participation and the need to extend and synthesize CSCL theories to conceptualize connected learning at multiple levels. The text emphasizes the importance of collaboration, interaction, and shared understanding in CSCL and suggests ways to enhance, support, and analyze cognition and learning in individuals, groups, and communities.
"""

filename = "practices.faiss"
about = """"
article published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, discussing the importance of analyzing group practices in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The author argues that traditional pre/post comparisons miss sequential interactional processes and reduce group phenomena to individual or social factors. The article emphasizes the need to study the enactment of practices by small groups in CSCL contexts to systematically inform the design, testing, and refinement of collaborative-learning software, curriculum, pedagogy, and theory. The author proposes that CSCL can be re-conceptualized as the design of technology to foster the adoption of group practices by student teams. The article also discusses the methodological tension in CSCL research, described as an opposition of quantitative versus qualitative approaches. The author argues for the need to analyze the group processes that bring about changes and establish group practices in CSCL to guide iterative design-based research. The text also includes four case studies that analyze group practices in CSCL, highlighting the importance of pointing practices, problem decomposition, turn-taking, software usage, and geometric construction for collaborative mathematics. The author suggests that a methodological focus on group practices can suggest the design of technologies, curriculum, and pedagogy to support the adoption of key group skills. The intended audience is researchers, educators, and practitioners in the field of CSCL, and the purpose of the article is to emphasize the importance of analyzing group practices in CSCL to inform the design, testing, and refinement of collaborative-learning software, curriculum, pedagogy, and theory. Interesting terms or jargon in the text include CSCL, group practices, design-based research, methodological tension, and iterative design-based research.
