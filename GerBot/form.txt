Introduction  
his volume of my assembled works differs from the other volumes of my 
eLibrary in multiple  ways. It does not present writings from my academic 
career but  displays artifacts that I created either as an escape from professional  
labors or following my retirement from academia. Rather than describing the design 
of immaterial software or theories, it  presents  photographs of and comments about 
physical objects —mostly sculptures —which  I fashioned out of materials like wood 
and clay.  
There are chapters on the following aesthetic creations  and approaches : 
1. My wood sculptures from 1976 to the present . Wood sculpture has been my primary 
artistic endeavor during my adult life. Every few years, I did a couple pieces. 
In retirement, I have been more productive. 
2. Clay sculptures and pottery from 1970 to the present . As a young child, my mother 
taught me basic pottery. I enjoyed occasionally working in clay in my 20s and 
always looked forward to doing more. I felt that the medium of abstract clay 
sculpture had much more potential than was represented in the art world, 
even though  clay may be considered one of the oldest surviving artistic medi a 
in the world. The universality of clay work may be attributed to its 
combination of utility and beauty. Retirement has allowed me to explore 
ceramic sculpture in my own studio as well as to take pottery lessons at local art centers.  
3. My houses, which I helped to design  with Carol in Philadelphia, Boulder, 
Philadelphia and Chatham in about 1978, 1997, 2004 and 2015. Having 
designed the Chatham  house incorporating many species of wood , I was 
eager to create wooden furniture to go with the house. The house was designed in 2014/15 and built in 2015/16. I constructed  the furniture in 
2016/17,  and the house was landscaped at that time as well. In 2017/18, I 
turned my basement furniture shop into a productive sculpture studio.  
4. Reflections  on organic form from nature . I strive to create asymmetrical, flowing, 
sensuous, organic forms whose structures are often inspired from human 
forms, animal shapes and other organisms or natural objects . Living by the 
ocean, I have sculpt ed some forms that I fou nd on the beach.  I am fascinated 
with the sophistication of sculptures dating back far into pre -history. I have 
made a few  sculptures based on such works , as well as studies of modern 
sculptors . 
5. Thoughts on opening up space . While my first wood sculptures followed closely 
the original solid form of the ir logs, I increasingly worked on “opening up” 
the mass of wood to peer inside and to create internal spaces , interconnected T

         6 
openings and negative 3 -D forms . Here I collect views of several of my 
sculptures to illustrate  possibilities for “opening up ,” and to indicate the 
development of my approach to this.  
6. The practice of sculpting 3 -D form in wood . This section documents the succession 
of techniques and tools I have often used in my wood sculpture, illustrated 
with photos from the creation of several different works.   
7. A chronological catalog of all my sculptural works, numbering about two  hundred  
all together, of diverse sizes , themes, forms  and materials.

Keep up to date with my sculpture by downloading the latest version of the e -book 
(pdf) at: http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form/form.pdf . The pdf is formatted the 
same as the printed  version. The digital format allows me to continuously add my 
latest items to the catalog and other chapters. Viewing the pdf allows you to search 
the text and zoom in on details of the sculptures.  
Further information about this volume is available at: 
http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form . Versions for Kindle  (mobi) and iBooks (epub)  
can be downloaded there, although they are not as up -to-date and well formatted as 
the pdf .  
Go to: https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture  to open a webpage with videos of many  of 
my sculptures. They display the sculpture slowly turning 360º . The videos are brief – 
mostly about half  a minute.  The videos are organized into five groupings:  
• Videos of some of my wood carvings . A catalog of my wood carvings is 
available at:  https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture/carvings . 
• Videos of some of my abstract ceramic sculptures , modeled in clay and fired.  
• Videos of some of my modernist ceramic sculptures , inspired by Rodin, 
Degas, Brancusi, Giacometti, Heppenworth, Moore.  
• Videos of some of my pre -Columbian and prehistoric ceramic sculptures , 
based on artifacts. 
• Videos of some of my realistic sculptures of the human body , based on live 
or photographed models.  
The videos help to display the 3 -D form, the "opening up" of the material , and the 
play of positive and negative space as discussed in this book. The videos are silent. 
You can make the video full screen by clicking on the square icon in the lower right corner of the video image. To return from full screen, click on the same icon or press

1. Sculpture: 3- D Form from Wood  
I began exploring wood sculpture in the mid -1970s.  Wood sculptures continued to 
be my most important sculptural works throughout my life.  Here are two large pieces 
from 2020:  
 
Angel of Progress  and Return of the Osprey . 
Following are my wood sculptures in chronological order.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         18 
Gelassenheit (1976) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         19 
  
Gelassenheit  (Let it be ). Black walnut . Pine Run, New Jersey. 1976. Influenced by Heidegger’s 
ontology of unfolding beings, I  let the character of the log lead me to bring out the beauty of 
its colorful grain and co re. I tried to form interesting sweeping shapes that portray and 
enhance  the strength and solidity of the log ’s mass.

Twisted Sister (1977) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         21 
  
Twisted Sister . Cherry. Pine Run, New Jersey. 1977. Not influenced by E .T. (which it 
predated). This cherry tree trunk contained knots that became integrated into the sculpture. I 
opened up a space between two legs, which curved asymmetrically to define an interesting 
negative form. On one leg surface, I created a relief based on Indonesian sculptural 
traditions.

         22 
Atomic Power (1983) 
 
Atomic Power . Cyprus. Philadelphia. 1983. This slab from a large tree was found in a dump of 
tree trunks, cut down by the City. I refined the outline of the slab and poked a hole 
surrounded by carving marks.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         23 
The Owl of Minerva (1995) 
 
The Owl of Minerva . Redwood. Niwot,  Colorado. 1995. Influenced by Hegel. I enjoyed carving 
4x4 redwood posts left from the deck of our Colorado house —easy to carve, retaining good 
edges, sanding smoothly, acquiring beautiful color when oiled and revealing strong, broad 
grain. Here, I not only opened a space between twisting legs, but also a large negative s pace 
at the head, drilling  all the way through to form an eye.  Gift to Alan.

         24 
Female Torso (1995) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         25 
  
Female Torso . Cottonwood. Niwot, Colorado. 1995.  Influenced by Bliss. A first attempt to 
represent a figure realistically. The sense of 3 -D proportion was achieved primarily by the 
sense of touch.

         26 
Common Senses (1996) 
 
Common Senses . Redwood and mixed  media. Niwot, Colorado. 1996. A fun project, 
representing the orga ns of sight, hearing, touch, sme ll and taste.  Gift to Zake.

2. Ceramics: 3 -D Form from Clay  
Ceramic Sculpture  
 
Bone sculpture , free form sculpture and pointy figure. First ceramic sculptures  I did at my 
first pottery studio session in Yarmouth near Chatham.  Later , coffee “mugs.”  
 
Once I started to create ceramic pieces, I did several exploratory series:  
• Paleolithic and Prehistoric Figure Series  
• Pre-Columbian Figure Series  
• Giacometti Studies Series  
• Negative Structures Series 
• Figurative Modeling Series  
• Facial Portrait Series  
• Sea Forms Series  
They are documented in the following sections.   

Works of 3 -D Form  
         63 
 
 
Model of Moore’s Reclining Figure: Holes  and model of Chocmool . Small models  I did at home , 
using self -drying red clay that does not need to be fired.

         65 
Paleolithic  and Prehistoric Figure Series  
 
Sculptors can learn a lot by creating studies of works of other sculptors, including 
from historical eras and other cultures. I found it particularly interesting to reproduce 
several of the earliest known sculptures. These are carvings in bone or stone, usually 
representing women, often pregnant. The carvings are impressive accomplishments, 
probably reflecting cross -generational communities of skilled carvers, perhaps 
women.  
Some of these prehistoric artifacts are small or fragmented, so I have tried to create a 
representation of them that is at a scale and level of detail that makes them easy to 
perceive and that brings out their underlying forms. The basic forms of the human  
body have clearly fascinated humans from their first attempts to represent figures in 
whatever materials were available – stone, bone, clay and eventually marble or bronze. 
It is a moving experience to reflect upon reproducing images created tens of 
thousands of years ago, when humans were  creating the first persistent self -
representations that we know of. In particular, the “Venus figures” that repeatedly appear across the populated world throughout millennia suggest the importance of 
widespread, multi -generational cultures involving langu age, tool skills, trade  and inter -
tribal communication.  
[See the section on “Pre -historic Sculptures” in Chapter 4, “ Reflections: Philosophy 
of 3-D Form,” below.]  
Here is a rough timetable of the figures I have tried to reproduce:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         66 
 
40,000-35,000 years before the present (BP), t he Venus of Hohle Fels  (also known as 
the Venus of Schelklingen  or the Tübingen Venus ) is an Upper Paleolithic  Venus figurine  
belonging to the early Aurignacian  culture , and is one of the oldest undisputed 
examples of Upper Paleolithic  art and figurative prehistoric art in general.  It is made 
of mammoth  ivory at the very beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, which is associated 
with the earliest presence of Cro -Magnon humans in Europe (where they mixed with 
Neanderthals – my own theory is that this mixing of species may have fostered the 
advent of art ). I came across the original figure in the archeological museum  in 
Tübingen  and was given a scale -model reproduction of it by a colleague who was 
friends with the archaeologist.

         67 
 
30,000– 27,000 BP, the Venus of Willendorf  was o riginal carved from an oolitic 
limestone that is not local to the area ; the stone may have come from across the Alps 
or 1,000 miles away. Parts of the body associated with fertility  and childbearing have 
been emphasized. Some hypothesize that such figurines may have been created as 
self-portraits by women, due to the correlation of the proportions of the statues to 
how women's bodies would seem when  looking down at themselves,  and to the lack 
of facial features .

         68 
    
29,000- 25,000 BP, the Venus of Dolni Vestonice -- ceramic  -- oldest known ceramic in 
the world, predating the use of fired clay to make pottery. The figurine was modeled 
from a mixture of clay and tempered bone and then fired . It is one of the first 
examples of ceramics.

         69 
 
27,000- 22,000 BP, the Venus of Laussel R elief. The original “Venus of Laussel” is a 
limestone bas -relief of a woman with the moon, marked off to count the lunar or 
menstrual cycle. Original carved on a cave wall and painted with red ochre.

         70 
 
 
25,000 BP, the Venus of Ostrava  (also known as  Venus of Petřkovice) – the original  
miniature headless female torso – only 5 cm in height – was carved from a piece of 
black hematite iron ore  during the  Gravettian industry culture. Uniquely, the absence 
of the head appears to be the author's intention. Also, unlike other prehistoric Venus 
figurines, it shows a slender young woman or girl with small breasts. It was discovered 
at an ancient settlement of m ammoth hunters.

         71 
    
21,000 BP, the Venus of New Avdeevo . This ivory figurine is generally well preserved. It 
is ten centimeters long with an erect head which has a sculptured face that looks 
forward and is covered by hair or a hat. shoulders are narrow, the chest is flattened, 
and the drop -shaped breasts lie slightly apart on top of t he slightly prominent 
abdomen. The forearms are beneath the breasts, under which the hands appear to be holding the upper part of the abdomen. The fingers are emphasized, and there is a 
bracelet on one wrist. A band decorated by a wedge -shaped notching is carved on the 
waist. The legs of this figurine are  slightly bent at the knees, below which they are 
separated by a bored hole.  A flattened area around the tailbone of this figurine 
emphasizes the absence of fatty deposits.

7,000- 4,500 BP, the Cylcadic standing figures  carved in marble on the Greek islands. 
These form a transition to the classic Greek sculpture at the start of the history of 
Western art.  
 
2,400 BP,  Nike of Samothrace – Winged Victory . The Nike (Victory) is represented with 
open wings, landing on the prow of a ship. The marble statue together with its base stood over 18 feet high above a sanctuary on the Northeast Aegean island of 
Samothrace , celebrating the victory of Rhodes at sea in 190 BCE. The goddess rests 
on her right leg as she lands. This leg is placed to the fore and draws her torso to the right, in contrast to her lower body which turns to the left. She wears garments that 
billow out behind her and double over in folds in front.  The active movement of this 
sculpture contrasts with the rigidity of Egyptian and Babylonian works, which preceded the classic Greek art.

Pre-Columbian Figure Series  
During my travels over my lifetime, I collected sculptures, especially pre -Columbian 
reproductions from Latin America. 
 
On the right are some I collected. On the left are some of what my family called 
“originalis,” small clay figures based on Aztec or Mayan sculptures. Also o n the left,  
an Olmec head that Carol won playing  tennis during our honeymoon in Veracruz and 
a Chacmool that my mother brought me from Mexico.  
Following are a series of ceramic sculptures that I did (lower shelf) based on these 
(upper shelf)  and other pre -Columbian figures in 2019.

         75 
 
The ancient ceramic pieces were made principally using coils and I noticed how small 
coils could be used for eyes and mouth. I also began to experiment with decorative 
finishes on my pieces, inspired by the Latin American cultures.  I sometimes 
referenced their love of gold, jade and turquoise.  As I read about pre -Columbian 
sculpture and ceramics, I was increasingly impressed by the subtle planes of facial 
images: the eye muscles and cheekbones were often modeled in graceful and 
expressive simplicity. Expres sion was conveyed more through decorative clothing and 
accessories than through facial countenance. I tried to adopt and adapt their sense of 
form and decoration.

Giacometti Studies Series  
After the pre -Columbian series, I did a series of studies based on Giacometti’s 
sculpture, especially his early cubist works. I read a lengthy biography of Giacometti, 
as well as books about other modern sculptors  such as Rodin and Degas. I began to 
experiment with making plaster casts of clay pieces as well as working directly in plaster , as Giacometti did .

Negative Structures Series  
As discussed in the chapter below on “Space: Opening Up 3 -D Form,”  much of my 
sculpture is concerned with penetrating the mass (wood, clay, plaster) of matter and 
creating an interior space or negative form within the positive material forms. A series 
of explorations of such negative structures in ceramics resulted in severa l pieces  in 
2008, such as the following: Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2,  Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture 
with Grog and  Negative  Structure . 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         85 
 
 
These ceramic works define spatial forms by creating structural boundaries or 
outlines. They open (create) space primarily by enclosing or surrounding it. Many of 
the spaces are cave -like, hinting at primordial cave rnous  living spaces. Here are some 
from 2022:

         86 
   
    
Complex spaces are interconnected within 3-D, in ways hard to visualize without the 
3-D structure to see, feel and explore. The pieces combine surface texture, volume, 
internal space and structure. Technically, they are constructed to balance the 
constraints of clay strength vs. gravity and span inte grity vs. the effects of shrinkage 
as the clay dries and is fired.

         87 
 
 
I continued to investigate structure sculptures in my 2021 clay maquettes and 2022 
wood carvings.  Some of these are made in several separate pieces, which are glued 
together in the end to create sparse structures defining open or negative spaces.

Figurative Modeling Series  
My older sculptures were rela tively abstract, non -figurative or  non-representational. 
Although people liked to see animals and other things represented in the sculptures, 
for me they were primarily explorations of abstract 3 -D form. However, once I began 
to work with clay and become more involved in learning about scu lpture, I began to 
take classes and workshops in figurative modeling, that is, capturing the human body 
in whole or in part as realistically as possible.  
I took courses on human portrait (the head), torso and full body. Some of these 
benefitted from live models. Most classes took place over multiple days at the Cotuit 
Center for the Arts, organized by Neil Grant.  
The portraitur e class helped me to see the st ructures of the human head : the bones 
of the skull, the muscles of the eyes and mouth, and the expressive flesh of people at different ages and engaged in talking or other behavior. After this class, I modeled a 
series of masks, presented in the next section.  
 
The workshops on torso and full body were usually two days long. They also stressed 
the structures and forms of the primary layers of skeleton, musculature, flesh and skin 
texture. The first day involved roughing a figure in using clay on a simple wooden 
armature  post. The second day refined the figure and its surface. Then the piece was 
hollowed out so it could dry without breaking from clay shrinkage and so it could 
safely be fired. In two days, I could not create a detailed and polished sculpture, 
captur ing the many aspects of realistic representation. Instead, I aimed at quick 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         91 
studies, which  caught the primary forms and retained a rough surface reflecting the 
working of the clay.  
 
The figurative works of reclining models and torsos complemented my other 
explorations of seated figures, such as  Reclining Figure: Holes  Model,  Chacmool , Pregnant 
Mayan  and Nyarit Seated Man .

Eight Ceramic Mask Selfies 
 
These eight self -portrait masks were made in Fall 2019. First, Bob Marcus helped me 
make a life- casting mask of my face from a kit. From the temporary mask, I made a 
plaster mold. Then I pressed slab s of clay into the mold and used the resulting curved 
form s as base s for modeling the clay selfies.  
It is hard to capture a personality in a mask because a person’s unique bone structure 
and muscle configuration changes continuously as they speak and move. The 
expressive muscles around the mouth change the most, but the eye muscles, smile 
wrinkles and ch eek bones also shift significantly.  
So, I tried to make a series of masks with different expressions and sculptural 
techniques. I took pictures of my face in the mirror as my model.  
I experimented with diverse ways  of representing 3 -D facial features. For instance, 
Rodin created undulating waves that seem to press outward from the interior of the 
work. Giacometti amassed small, indistinct bits to define human forms without 
recreating smooth surfaces in order to just provide an impression of the form as seen 
ambiguously from a distance. When I fired the pieces, I sometimes used colored slips to add color to the white, brown or reddish clay.

Sea Forms Se ries 
Since I live by the ocean now, I am interested in exploring natural shapes in forms 
from the sea.  
Seashells fascinate me. They come in complex and beautiful forms, which are grown 
by strange organisms (clams, oysters, etc.) and are often adopted by other organisms 
(such as small crabs) when their original creators outgrow them.  
 
I carved some long, twisting forms based on seashells I found on the beach. 
 
This is a sculpture I did in clay, modeled on a smaller bone from the beach, probably a seal’s 
spinal disk  
Ocean waves are the results of complex interactions of water rushing in different 
directions as well as the slope of the shore  floor. Waves roll in to the beach relentlessly 
and rhythmically. They are calming to hear and watch, in their repetition, endless variety and perpetual motion. Standing on the shoreline, one can observe the water 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         119 
from the last wave rolling back into the sea, where it is met by and overpowered by 
the next wave rushing in. The under and over flowing of the opposed movements 
create the breaking wave front. The interaction is so fluid and quick that it is hard to 
follow. Sculpture of a wave front can strive to capture and freeze this ceaseless 
motion.

Casting in Plaster  
Inspired by Giacometti’s plaster sculptures and casts, I decided to try sculpting in 
plaster and ma king plaster casts of clay sculptures. Of course , sculptors primarily  cast 
their sculptures to preserve them and to make multiple copies for sale. Casting in 
bronze goes back to prehistory. Plaster casting is a less expensive and complicated 
alternative. Today, there are many plastic and resin options  as well . 
Even before reading about Giacometti, I had started to use plaster and to make some 
simple casts with hints from local sculptors (Neil  Grant , Hiram  Ball and Bob  Marcus). 
As an aid to my series of masks, I made one -piece casts of a model skull in clay, and 
I made one- piece clay molds of my Nickerson coins . I also made simple casts of  my 
masks of Ruby and Ora for distribution to relatives.  
When I did the studies of Giacometti, I had to create completely  three -dimensional 
molds , rather  than the one-sided forms for the masks. I started to use EZ -Mix 40 
urethane rubber for the molds and eventually Free -Form Air for two -piece mother 
molds to hold the molds during casting. I switched from plaster of Paris to Hydrocal, a stronger form of plaster. The EZ -Mix 40 liquid rubber was painted onto a clay 
sculpture, which had been waxed as a release. When the rubber hardened, the mold 
had to be slit to tak e out the sculpture. The mother mold was designed to hold the 
slit closed, but that was tricky in practice. I took a four -day course on mold making 
and then made three more -successful molds at home.  
 
These are the three plaster casts that emerged . 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         135 
 
Here is my portrait of Giacometti. Behind it is the blue rubber cast with the jagged 
slit for removing the cast and the gray mother -mold that holds the flexible mold in 
place during the pouring of the liquid plaster.  
Many of Giacometti’s clay sculptures decayed and crumbled in his studio. His brother, 
Diego, made molds and plaster casts, which saved many sculptures. I can see how this was important , as several of my studies of Giacometti also broke , and the plaster casts 
were a way to preserve them.  Giacometti cast his clay sculptures in plaster and 
eventually in bronze for sale. He did not fire the clay because he usually worked on 
metal armatures to support the clay.  
I customarily  fire and sometimes glaze  my clay originals. I often paint the plaster casts 
to look gold  or bronze. Here are my casts of the Pregnant Mayan, Tony’s Torso  and my 
portrait of the artist. Other casts are shown in the section on Giacometti Studies and 
in the Catalog.

Above are two plaster c asts of my study of Giacometti ’s “Tall Figure, ” One is painted 
bronze. 
In addition to creating a bronze appearance with metallic paints, I tried “cold casting” 
my Portrait of Giacometti . This involves mixing powdered bronze metal into the top 
coat of the black epoxy used for casting.  
 
Other casts of my studies of Giacometti’s early cubist works follow:  his “Head ,” 
“Couple ,” “Torso” and “Head .”

Cold Casting in Bronze  
After a busy season with clay and plaster casts, I finished 2019 by returning to wood 
carving, completing A Bite of the Apple , Sea Goddess of the Cape , Hinged Forms  and Return 
of the Osprey . I then took a break from sculpture, including two months in Florida. I 
returned home in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic.  
Without access to a kiln, I decided to focus on cold casting bronze, as I had attempted 
with the bust of Giacometti. I had in mind reproducing two sets of my clay figures:  
• A historic series in honor of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims landing on 
Cape Cod, with the Nickerson coin, the mask of William Nickerson and the 
mask of Josiah Mayo.   
• A series of prehistoric women: Venus  from Tubingen , Venus of Willendorf , Venus 
Relief, Larger Cycladic Figure and Athena.  
I acquired some new casting materials from the closeout of Hiram’s studio. I made 
the molds using Rebound 25, a flexible rubber material. I made mother molds from 
Free form Air, to hold the molds during casting. I cast using SmoothCast Onyx Slow, 
a black plastic, mixing in 1/3-part bronze filings. To bring out the bronze sheen, I 
rubbed the castings with steel wool and sprayed on a transparent finish  or waxed 
them . I also used Smooth- On 325, a casting material I had used for the Portrait of 
Giacometti  and the first set of bronze coins and bronze masks.  
The coin molds and mask molds were simple one -piece open molds. I poured the 
liquid casting mixture into the mold and swished it around to cover the surface to an 
adequate depth. I mounted two sets of the coin inverse and reverse for display, as well 
as the masks of Nickerson and Mayo.  These were for display at the Mayo House and 
the Nickerson Homestead exhibitions. I also cast bronze copies for myself.

The historic series was more problematic. It turned out that the clay I had used for 
Venus of Willendorf and the Venus relief was incompatible  with the mold material, so 
they bound together and I had to discard the original sculpture along with its mold.  
The Venus  from Tubingen  casting did not work well; it came our covered with sticky 
black liquid from the casting mixture . I made round bases for the original and for the

Photography of Ceramics and Sculpture  
Sculpture is famously difficult to photograph. Of course, one problem is that you 
cannot capture much of a 3 -D form in a 2 -D medium. But in addition, the subtleties 
of the surface are tricky to reproduce. Lighting, shadow, highlights, etc. are important 
in bringing out the three- dimensionality, depth and surface texture  
With advice from photographer Brown  Bergen , I bought a camera with good control 
of depth of field (F -stop) and experimented by taking many of the photos in this 
book, especially for the pieces created in 20 19. I also bought a set of photography 
lights and backdrops. I set up a photography area in a dark part of the basement so I 
could control the lighting.  
One thing I tried to do was capture the depth of my attempts to “open up” the mass 
of my wood and ceramic sculptures.

4. Reflections:  Philosophy of 3-D 
Form  
“One must give value to one’s existence by behaving as if one's very existence were a work of art.”   
        – Fr. Nietzsche  
Thoughts on Organic F orm from N ature 
Prior to retirement, I occasionally carved wooden logs. I followed the lead of the log 
and of my tools, producing flowing curves that brought out the beauty and sensuality 
of the wood , as it had grown within a tree . I felt a kinship to the sculptures of Henry 
Moore and learned  about the abstraction of 3 -D form  from his masterpieces. As I 
became more involved in sculpture —including ceramics and plaster casts —I 
wondered increasingly about the role and nature of sculpture in today’s world, given 
the developmen ts in the field during my lifetime. This chapter presents  some of my 
reflections on that question.  
Historically, organic sculptural form was often associated with representation of the bodies of humans and animals. The invention of mechanical reproducibility with 
photography and video not only changed the aura of th ose work s (according to 
Benjamin), but also questioned the role of realistic likeness in sculpture. Modern 
European sculpture transitioned from realistic representation to more abstract study 
of 3-D forms in the oeuvres of Rodin, Brancusi, Degas, Giacometti, Moore, etc. That 
transition period in the history of sculpture by the generation or two before me has 
appealed to me more than subsequent developments, like metal constructions of 
geometric or industrial forms, experiments with high -tech materials , environmental 
happenings or pop- art plays on everyday artifacts.  
As this book documents, I have explored a delimited range of possibilities of 20
th and 
21st century sculpture. This included studies and reproductions of ancient sculptures, 
including the earliest known human  examples: Paleolithic, Cycladic, pre -Columbian 
and modern masterpieces. I took courses on realistic sculpture of the human body 
and used live models for portraits and torsos, to develop and understand the 
techniques involved  and to study the forms . The idea of “opening up” a log or lump 
of clay to crea te negative as well as positive forms and spaces is one specific direction 
that I have pursued.

The Working of a Work of Art 
Art— in contrast to objects of daily utility —functions to make our world visible, 
tangible and sensuous. It opens up the working  of the works of art. One wants to 
explore, touch, move around and contemplate pieces of sculpture in ways one rarely 
interacts with other objects . Everyday things are simply present for use in actions that 
are focused on implicit  goals;  we tacitly exploit  these objects as mere subservient 
means , paying little heed to their inherent qualities  and visual  appearance . 
Space is the Place 
Works of art draw attention to themselves, rather than to some other realm. They 
stand out in the everyday world by creating their own space. Space is an unobserved  
structure that is normally taken for granted or abstracted as a simple mathematical 
configuration  or empty volume . We move through space and glance through space 
without explicitly perceiving  the space itself. Every physical object takes up a space, 
which it defines by the volume within and around its surface. By displaying itself as a 
visual object, a sculpture can make visible the space it fills and the space it opens up 
around itself. It is even possible for a sculpture to be designed to open up spaces 
within the positive forms of the sculpture’s material, creating negative spaces , which can 
themselves become centers of focus .  
Making Reality Visible 
Objects from different realms have different forms. Sculptures can make these 
obtrusive and perceptible. Architecture  (which was originally inseparable from 
sculpture)  can both construct and reveal the spaces within which humans reside. Pop 
art makes the character of everyday, taken -for-granted commodities noticeable. 
Forms of the sea and sea life differ from those of the land ; sculpture can contrast 
these forms . Scale —which sculpture can play with —also makes a difference, bringing 
out details, relationships and spaces that are hidden on accustomed scale s. 
Mass Production 
Manufactured  objects today are commercial  commodities, explicitly designed for easy 
mass production by automated machinery , and mass produced with standardization 
for universal assembly. They have flat, 2 -D surfaces , following simpl istic 
mathematical shapes. They are efficient to fabricate  by machine and are 
interchangeable to facilitate  economical exchange on the global commodity market. 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         190 
They are derived forms of abstract value, not specific to any characteristics of origin, 
setting or intended application.  
Natural Evolution 
Organic forms, by contrast , evolve in response to their immediate environment. Their 
form follows from their uniquely situated function: a tree’s limbs bend to allow their 
leaves to capture sunlight in their particular setting , and a bird’s bones are shaped to 
provide strength and mobility with minimal weight and mass. Such conditions of growth result in flowing, but unique and complex  formations, with parts that support 
distinct functions  connected by transitional forms, which flow into each other, rather 
than simply butting up against each other and requiring connectors. An organism 
consists of an integrated formation  of multiple parts , with specialized forms merging  
into each other.  Organic sculpture can aim  to capture such structure in ways that 
display it to an observer’s senses.  
The Manufactured Environment  
In a philosophic passage, I once wrote that my sculptures are responses to the artificial character of the contemporary synthetic  environment. T oday’s  urban setting consists 
of plastic and concrete structures manufactured with homogenous materials and 
uniform geometric shapes, rather than with the organic forms of natur e. Technologies 
of manufacture have imposed these rigid, flat, symmetric shapes that are totally controlled by their makers  and machines. These shapes are simple and instantly 
understood by o bservers, so they fade into the background of assumed second nature , 
rather than provoking attention .  
In the twentieth century, several sculptors explored biomorphic abstraction , which 
features the subtle, flowing forms of biological nature in contrast to manufactured 
designs. These sculptures have always appealed to me and inspired my own efforts. 
Perhaps the biomorphic approach complemented the mathematical paradigm, which 
dominated my professional life in computer science.  
Organic Form 
My sculptures are not ahistorical ; not the result of some primordial experience of self -
consciousness interacting with unmediated nature. They are late -twentieth -century  
and early -twenty -first-century  explorations of form and material. In them, organic 
three -dimensional forms are showcased to contrast with socially prevalent two -
dimensional representations and with the basic geometric shapes produced by 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         191 
automated machinery. The inherent characteristics of the materials of nature are 
brought forth, in contrast to the artificial plastic substances that retreat from our 
consciousness in commodities. Furthermore , the usual pragmatic representational 
function of semiotic  objects is overcome  in the study of their abstracted physical 
forms and materiality. In negating  and surpassing  (Hegel: “ Aufhebung ”) the 
commonplace characteristics of signs —which point away from themselves —the non-
representational sculptures o btrusively confront their creator and viewers with the 
nature of the artifact itself as intentionally formed material object. Not representing 
some external subject, they point to themselves.  
Biomorphic Form and Cubism 
Biological organisms have evolved over eons to integrate multiple organs. Each organ 
has its distinctive function. The structure of the organism unites its constituent organs  
together in to a smooth functioning , creating a higher -level formation. Analogously, a 
complex sculpture can integrate multiple 3 -D forms, which complement or contrast 
with each other. Different faces of a particular mass can assume forms at tension with 
each other. A successful sculpture unifies its many sub-forms into a coherent 
structure.  My wood sculptures tend to be biomorph ic, often adopting 3 -D forms 
similar to biological organisms.  
Cubism tried to capture multiple visual perspectives on an object simultaneously. As 
works of 3 -D form, sculptures embody multiple perspectives when viewed from 
shifting angles. Cubism freed the arrangement of parts of a given object —such as 
organs within an organism or body —and sculpture can ad opt that freedom by 
displaying parts of a body selectively according to a unity of the sculpture that differs 
from that of its model —such as repositioning the features of a human face or body 
to highlight them indivi dually . The structure of the sculpture re presents selective 
aspects and arrangements of its model, while presenting  its own structural form , its 
re-integration of formal elements.  
A sculpture may integrate subparts at multiple levels. A complex form like Return of 
the Osprey may have numerous parts, each of which forms an organism of 3 -D forms 
flowing into each other. It may take a viewer some time and effort to explore the 
sculpture at different scales and viewing angles.  
Rodin’s dynamic human poses  and Degas’ dancers make visual and haptic the 
structural potentials of the human body, with its joints and musculature. They often 
exceed or exaggerate the possible poses, combining specific perspectives and 
consecutive views slightly out of time. There is a tension between the model and the 
sculpture, in which post -photographic realism extends what is possible in the literally 
represented original.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         192 
Rodin Working on Works 
In his evocative book on Rodin, Rilke emphasized the creation of “ works” as a driving 
force for Rodin. The ephemeral w ork on sculptures was often more important than 
the persistent sculptures that resulted. The resultant sculptures were always somehow 
considered inadequate  by Rodin ; the problems that had been pursued in them were 
not completely or satisfactorily solved; it was hard to say when a given piece was 
finished —except by noting if it had been signed in preparation  for sale. Rodin lived 
above all to engage in his sculptural  work ing. 
Degas never exhibited or sold his sculptures, except for “The Little Dancer.” He did 
not cast them, but simply worked on them in his studio for their own sake , as 
explorations of the possibilities of sculpture and the potentials of human bodily movement through space. Similarly , Giacometti  was driven to work and re -work his 
pieces endlessly , searching to capture his vision, rather than to produce finished 
pieces. The important thing is the working that goes into the work, rather than the 
resultant object, w hich captures  and preserve s the working.  Rodin, Giacometti and 
Degas all liked to come back to old pieces and re -work them —undercutting the sense 
that works were ever final, that th ey were no longer subject to working.  
In my recent involvement in sculpture, m y days often revolve around an agenda of 
working on some current piece. The point is not so much to produce yet more  object s, 
since I am not selling or using the resultant products. The point is to engage in the 
work, explore a sculptural or technical problem, re -discover what some other sculptor 
found in creating something that inspired me. The working is more important than the work , which drives and results from the working . Often, I attempt to capture 
something ab out the working in the resultant work.  
Degas’s Dancers 
Sculpture  can display the structure of objects, rather than just their surface 
appearances and attributes. Degas’ dancers, balanced instantaneously on one leg, 
capture the ephemeral structure of a ballerina’s motion through space around a center 
of gravity. The placement of the ballerina’s feet and the twist of her torso reflect 
slightly different moments in time and thereby imply and capture motion, like the 
subtly superimposed feet of Degas’ galloping horses , caught impossibly in mid -air. 
Although Degas’ sculptures , like “Grand Arabesque ,” represent  the human  form 
realistically, they a re freed from traditional conventions to centrally incorporate space, 
void and motion by allusion. His fleshed- out female forms begin to act as structural 
indications of space, with limbs reaching out in every direction. Dance suggests the 
flux of time, in which Degas’ figures unfold from one study to the next in growing 
configurations of space and figure integrated. Degas thereby defi ned the transition 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         193 
from representation to structu re in the history of sculpture according to Charles 
Millard, Curator of the Hirshhorn  Museum , in his study of Degas . 
Giacometti’s Plaster Sculptures 
Giacometti’s emaciated plaster busts and human figures capture the core spatial 
existence of a man or woman. The irreducible residue of one of his female sculpture s 
reduces her entire reality to being seen, according to John Berger, who feels that 
Giacometti created his plaster figures during his lifetime , for himself, as observer or 
anticipator of his future absence, his death, his becoming unknowable after occupying 
an un -shareable reality. We now take the place of Giacometti in looking at the tall 
woman , in her structure as a solitary presence.  
Despite all the talk of Giacometti’s figures as representing existential alienation, his 
figures inevitably take up social and spatial positions in the shared world —with the 
many other plaster figures in his studio, with selected companions in exhibition 
collections and within spaces explicitly defined by their platforms, glass enclosures 
and metal cage outlines. Individual human forms are elements in composite material 
and social structures.   
The structure s of Giacometti’s constructions prominently include  spatial 
relationships, with the distances between plaster figures indicating social distances and 
their glances passing by and ignoring each other to accentuate the reduction to solitary 
individuals in communal settings. The spaces defined between figures , cages or 
platform edges create distance from the viewer, much as a painting’s chosen 
perspective does. Giacometti’s sculpture creates vacuum  (nothingness) , starting from 
mass or plenum  (being) , according to Sartre— locating his friend’s work within the 
dialectical conceptualizations of Being and Nothingness . The radically reduced positive 
space of the sculpture  projects negative space all about it, stretching out to the viewer 
and distancing the figure as alone and un -reachable. 
I have been intrigued by the creation of space through configurations of matter and void. Lived, meaningful space is not a mathematical manifold or Newtonian 
coordinate system, extending uniformly everywhere, absolute and independent of 
content arbitrarily located within it. Rather, it is a felt openness to being, projected 
around specific materials in concrete formations. Space invites and envelopes  objects, 
flows around them, opens  opportunities for other shapes; it  penetrates into gaps 
through and betwee n the objects. The sculptural form opens up the space in which 
matter  appears and also in which it pointedly does not appear.  
In my attempts to open up masses, such as in my recent ceramic constructions  (see 
below  my “Thoughts on opening up spaces”),  I create  structures that define intricate 
positive and negative spaces without covering up the surface o r filling in the interior.  
One way to open up a space most effectively is to reduce the mass of the positive 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         194 
focal form to a minimum, as Giacometti did in his mature sculptures. For Giacometti, 
this approach corresponded to the character of human vision.  He said he struggled 
to capture what his eye actually perceive d, as opposed to what the mind constructs as 
a figure. Of course, his eye was uniquely trained by a lifetime of looking carefully at 
models. Moreover, what he referred to as the mind  that imposes meanings was its 
preconceptions and stereotypical images.  
Realistic Sculpture 
For a while, I work ed on realistic sculptures of live models and from photos of people, 
especially human faces, including my own. Working from a live model is invaluable 
training for seeing the structures of heads and bodies. Standard techniques  for 
creating masses and planes  are also helpful in roughing in the 3- D forms. However, 
the rote representation of a subject using established techniques for reproducing some 
supposedly objective view of the subject is not in itself  an artistic process. For 
instance, using pointing machines in the baroque era to produce copies of living 
bodies was useful for some processes, like making copies of a sculpture, but less for 
creating an original work of art.  
When we see somebody —not by staring at their facial image as at a photo— as part 
of interacting with them, we do not perceive a smooth manifold with standard features and manifold details. We see the person, the personality, perhaps as 
synthesized into  a vague mental  image of their general likeness  or attitude .  
Consequently,  a sculptural representation of the person should not be a 3 -D 
reproduction of their body, frozen at one instant. It should be something that projects 
their personality. That is the source of Rodin’s emotional movement, often distorting 
the surface in energized waves of vibration. Similarly, it is the person’s spatia l 
presence, at its essential core in Giacometti’s structures, which resist being confined to precise and smooth appearances. These sculptures may not look “realistic” in the 
photogr aphic sense, but the artists felt that they captured living reality in a sculptural 
way. 
The critic, Leo Steinberg, argued that realistic sculpture is important even after the invention of the camera, but not in a rote, technological sense. He claimed that “the 
eye is part of the mind,” that is , that  
“technical capacity in imitation implies what no one seriously believes: that nature confronts man with a fixed, invariant look. We know better than that. 
Appearances reach us through the eye, and the eye is part of the brain and 
therefore inextricably inv olved in mysterious cerebral operations. Thus, nature 
presents every generation (and every person who will use his eyes for more than 
nodding recognitions) with a unique and unrepeated facet of appearance…. And 
Works of 3 -D Form

if appearances are thus unstable in the human eye, their representation in art is 
not a matter of mechanical reproduction, but of progressive revelation.”  
Works connected with discoveries of representation, purvey not given facts, but “the 
thrill and wonder of cognition. ” 
According to Steinberg, about half the great art generated by humanity —starting with 
Paleolithic art —is dedicated to the accurate transcription of the sensible world. 
However, artists do so in particular ways, rendering their subjects according to 
available technologies, cultures, conceptualizations, predecessors and the gleanings of their own work. Standardized techniques for capturing likeness miss the to -be-
interpreted character of the subject.  
A modern photo can instantaneously reproduce the physical appearance of a subject 
at a specific moment. However, for instance in the case of a face speaking or a body 
moving, the muscles involved (with their accompanying prominences and shadows) 
are contin uously shifting. The perceived appearance over a time segment posits the 
unity to these momentary stages. It is the interpreted unity that projects an underlying character or personality or motion or emotion to the subject. The challenge is to then 
represe nt in a 3 -D form the subject’s character through this unity —rather than simply 
a photo -like snapshot picture. If “realistic” means aiming for the snapshot, then 
sculpture needs to incorporate the techniques of realism without setting them as the 
ultimate  aim. The representational goal is, rather, to capture the personality that shines 
through the unity of the likeness.  
Tutorials on realistic sculpture rightly emphasize procedures of building up from 
skeleton to musculature to flesh (fat and skin). These are the layers that  conduct the 
body’s motion: the joints, the tendons and the masses. They are not static structures, but vibrant effectors of motion. As they shift and swirl, the body’s forms swell and 
ebb. Each individual’s figure is defined by its unique configuration of  bones, muscles, 
fat deposits and skin wrinkles. As a person breathes, speaks and moves, this unique 
complex cycles through its characteristic topologies. The sculptor struggles to capture 
this through his eye, mind, body, materials, skills, techniques and  style. 
Eye and Mind 
For the philosopher Merleau -Ponty, human existence is fundamentally embodied. 
Visual perception is the primary mode of perception of the human body. Vision is 
intimately integrated with our tactile sense, so that “the visible world and the world 
of my motor projects are eac h total parts of the same Being ” (Eye and Mind ). 
Sculpture corresponds to this foundational unity of vision and touch. A sculpture 
leads the hand and eye across its surfaces, whether actually or in the perceiver’s 
imaginative projection . Unlike painting or even relief, the 3 -D forms lure perception 
around the facing façade and into the sculpture’s depth. Although only certain shifting 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         196 
surfaces are v isible at any given moment, the  different perspectives  possible from 
around the mass  flow into each other, evoking and leading eye and hand and mind.  
Sculpture explores the depth of objects in the world. While depth is merely implied 
in painting, through tricks of perspective and shading, for instance, it is  explicit in the 
massing of 3 -D forms.  The sub- forms of a sculpture reference each other by 
overlapping and concealing —only to then reveal as one circumnavigates the 
sculpture. As Merleau -Ponty puts it, “The enigma consists in the fact that I see things , 
each one in its place, precisely because they eclipse one another , and that they are 
rivals before  my sight precisely because each one is in its own place.”  As one 
successively perceives each facet, the previously seen  planes recede into hidden but 
remembered depths. Each angle on the sculpture reveals new, unanticipated forms 
and integrates them into a felt 3 -D whole, with depth in space.  
The sculpture’s flow of curves and obtrusive features forms a surface, creating a 
boundary between the surrounding transparent space and the opaque internal mass. 
Depending upon the material of the sculpture, one may wonder about the nature of 
the interior. For instance, the hidden grain within  a wood sculpture , its transition from 
outer to core wood,  residues of its  sticky amber sap, origins  of its former branches 
and other organic vestiges of its growth  may suggest mysterious  structures of potential 
interest. The hardness of stone may challenge one to desire a glimpse inside  and the 
homogeneity of clay might motivate an urge to break its impenetrability.  
The dynamic of the observer’s perception of a work has its correspondence in the 
prior production of the work by the sculptor. The sculptor undergoes similar 
perceptual processes, possibly more focused, even conscious  or reflective. The forms 
emerge in the work  as the sculptor may attempt to bring out,  structure and mold  the 
perceptual effects . The material offers unexpected features and the sculptor’s work 
responds by enhancing or removing selected features to create interesting forms and 
an over- all work,  with its effects of perceptual stimulation, motion, depth and space . 
The successive stages of sculpting define forms at different scales, which may be 
compatible with each other. The selection of a particular log or a bag of clay; the 
roughing in of the log o r the massing of clay; the construction of major forms or 
primary  structural elements; the defining of flowing or rough surfaces; the refining of 
forms and surfaces; the finishing of surfaces with oil, glaze, paint, embedded elements; the mounting of the finished piece; lighting; photography; display ; presentation . 
A sculptor who explores and learns about specific material forms  may try to render 
those discoveries visible and even dramatic in the work  as a being  in the world .

A Heideggerian View of Sculpture  
In his essay on “The Thing,” the philosopher of Being, Heidegger , considers  the 
example of a jug, as created by a potter on a wheel. He suggests  that the thingness of 
the jug is centered on its  interior void, which can be filled with water or wine and can 
offer it for pouring and imbibing. But he does not describe how the jug comes to be 
what it is  as a unique being.  
Learning to make pottery  involves acquiring skills and knowledge to be able to 
produce jugs and other ceramic works that more or less fulfill th e ability of a 
successful jug. This has many aspects; creating a jug (e.g., on a potter’s wheel) involves 
a series of phases: acquiring and preparing the clay, gathering the tools and equipment, 
centering the lump of clay on the rotating wheel, opening a void in the lump, pulling 
the sides up in several pulls without the sides collapsing, shaping the form  (with the 
interior curve corresponding to  the exterior curve), partially drying the piece to give 
it strength, trimming the thrown piece and cutting a foot on it, gently shaping  a spout 
that will pour without dripping, attaching a pulled length of clay for a handle that will 
fit a human grip and p rovide balanced lifting, slowly  drying the clay without cracking, 
optionally adding design to the surface, firing the jug, glazing it and firing it again.  
Each stage of producing the jug is an experiment and the final product is always 
somewhat of a surprise. One learns through years of practice how to control each 
phase and what one prefers as results of each stage. However, at most phases there is 
usually some interplay between one ’s aims and the results. Generally, when one sees 
the piece as it is uncovered during the drying or when it comes out of the kiln, one is confronted by an object with its own character, and one must take up what one finds 
as the starting point for the next phase . As Hegel said, the worker is alienated from 
his product as it becomes an independent object existing in the world. There are so 
many variables in the clay, the wheel speed, the drying conditions, the pressure of the 
hands, the chemical reactions of the glaze and the work of the potter that one can 
only approach an ideal of control where one can produce something like w hat one set 
out to make. Such control takes considerable experimentation and practice.  
Ceramic jugs are one of the oldest and most universal of human artifacts. Once humans around the world harnessed fire, they learned to make and “fire” (bake) useful 
and beautiful jugs. My study of pottery is part of my philosophic investigation of the 
nature of artifacts. 
In The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger writes:  
“Although it becomes actual only as the creative act is performed, and thus 
depends for its reality upon this act, the nature of creation is determined by the 
nature of the work…. To create is to cause something to emerge as a thing that 
has been brought forth. The work’s becoming a work is a way in which truth 
becomes and  happens. ”  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         198 
The craft of the artist involves  creating  a work  that opens up a world and reveals 
something  (as discussed in  my philosophy dissertation) . This craft requires a 
dialectical back and forth between the artist’s inquiring over time and the successive 
revelations  of the art works  produced.  The artist— akin to  a philosopher or scientist —
proceeds along  a journey of inquiry, gradually revealing new truth s through sequences 
of more -or-less insightful works. This is a historical process, in which the artist pushes 
his or her own previous inquiries further in specific directions, confronting issues that 
arose in past works and employing techniques that have been developed in previous 
inquiries , including by earlier artists . This involves mastering crafts, materials and 
technologies  of the past or of earlier  works . It involves posing specific problems to 
solve , and new directions to explore. 
In his discussion of a van Gogh painting, Heidegger generally misses its art -historical 
importance. He views the painting as purely representational of a peasant woman’s 
shoes. He misses the relationship to the impressionist revelations about light (and 
shadow) or van Gogh’s own exploration of brushstroke as an elem ent of the 
materiality of paint.  
The work involves a dynamic between revealing and concealing. As a work, a 
sculpture opens a special space around itself, structured by its 3 -D form, which 
reaches  out in that space. The surfaces of the form are revealed, but they 
simultaneously conceal what lies below , behind  or beyond the surface: the interior of 
the wood, stone or other material  and its hidden facets . This dynamic that takes place 
at the surface of a sculpture is Heidegger’s notion of the “ Riss,” which I always found 
to be the most obscu re concept in his essay on art. I did not fully realize how Riss 
entails  both the tearing conflict between un -concealing and re -concealing and also the 
design, outline or figure of the work, e.g., the surface form of a sculpture , which 
defines its shape while enclosing its interior  and indicating its hidden perspectives . 
Certain sculptures may attempt to open up th e concealed  interior— for instance by 
poking a hole into or through the surface forms , or by chipping away the smooth 
outer surface to expose internal material —and perhaps simultaneously to reveal the 
effort of carving the material by leaving traces of that human effort and procedure.  
Through such elements of the work’s design, the interior is opened up, but then 
simultaneously closed up along the new surfaces of the holes. 
Negative form can be viewed as an effort to reverse what is concealed and what is 
revealed. In some sculptures, I have tried to reveal the space itself by simply outlining 
it or otherwise indicating it. In others, I have tried to open up the normally conce aled 
interior space by providing just a structure to define it as a space, while leaving the 
interior— or at least the interior space —visible.  One could consider Giacometti’s thin 
plaster sculptures to be presenting just the interior of a figure, absent the  usual 
concealing layer of fat and skin.  (See my Study of Giacometti Tall Figure in contrast to 
my Chatham Sunbather  or Tony’s Torso.)   
Works of 3 -D Form  
         199 
In my Globe Structure Maquette , the work is almost reduced to its supporting structure.  
This opens up the surface of the globe that would have covered it, revealing not just 
the interior space, but also the structures of hidden sides. Although each individual 
perspective provides a different, unanticipated image of the work, it also reveals 
enough of the other sides  to show how they relate. In addition, in this work the 
negative spaces become as important as the positive forms, often seeming to support 
or at least define them.   
 
    
    
 
The inquiries into opening up that began with pocking a hole in a solid mass have 
here reached a point where the negative spaces open connections among the various 
surfaces. Both negative and positive spaces flow into each other in complex ways, which guide the observer’s hand, eye and mind around the structure.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         200 
The work of art is also a communication between the creator and the observer of the 
work, an attempt to guide the viewer/preserver to see what the creator has made 
visible in the work. As Heidegger notes  about viewing art, “Preserving the work does 
not reduce people to their private experiences, but … grounds being for and with one 
another as the historical standing -out of human existence in reference to un -
concealed -ness.” Thus, the work functions to build historically situated inter -
subjectivity , grounded in the work . 
 A work of sculpture brings some thing into the world, opening up a space for it to 
do its work  in its historical social setting.  It is interesting to consider how sculpture 
has worked in different periods of human creativity.

Pre-histor ic Sculpture 
Like every cultural tradition, sculpture is an on -going conversation across generations 
of practitioners. Art is considered a characteristically human mode of expression. 
Sculpture as 3 -D form takes its place along with 2- D drawing or painting, music, 
dance, and other art forms. Particularly since communication was established globally, artists in one part of the world have been influenced by exemplars  of art from other 
places and times. For instance, it is now possible to see paradigmatic samples of art 
from the primary stylistic epochs and principal world regions collected next to each 
other at major museums.  
I have been interested in prehistoric  and non -European sculpture, particularly during 
my travels to the countries where these were created. Sculptures from non -
technological cultures  are often quite abstract, in the sense that they abstract away 
from details and capture larger forms in a stylized way. This abstraction may be 
attributed to the limitations of the sculptural materials (bone, stone, clay) and tools 
(hand, sharpened rock) or to cultural traditions or to some innate human mode of 
observation, tho ught and expression. One can learn much from these works. I was 
astonished at the extent to which the oldest known sculpture of the human figure 
teaches you when you try to duplicate it  and was delighted by how the earliest Latin 
American  carvings do so as well.  
In my own sculptural attempts, I have often tried to follow the lead of historic (or 
pre-historic) examples. By mimicking their forms in my own way and in my own 
materials, I have been inspired and gained insight into 3 -D form s. 
The T übingen V enus 
The Venus of Hohle Fels is an Upper Paleolithic figurine dated to between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest undisputed examples of figurative 
prehistoric art.  This figurine of a voluptuous woman carved from mammoth ivory 
and excavated from a cave in southwestern Germany is the oldest known example of 
3-D or figurative representation of humans , and sheds new light on the origins of art.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         202 
 
Four views of the Venus of Hohle Fels. The figure is about 2 ½ inches tall  (slightly larger 
than the picture here ). 
The intricately carve d headless figure is at least 5, 000 years older than previous 
figurines and dates from shortly after the arrival of genetically modern humans in 
Europe. It exhibits many of the characteristics of fertility, or Venus, figurines ca rved 
millennia  later.  
It was found in southern Germany in the Danube valley, the migration corridor for 
modern Homo Sapiens into Europe. The figurine’s  site was successively and 
repeatedly home to both Neanderthals  and Homo S apiens . This raises the possibility 
that such figurative art arose through the confrontation or intermixing of these two 
humanoid species. There is no evidence of art in the culture of the Neanderthals, but 
also no art like this in the culture of Homo Sapiens until they left Africa and met the 
Neanderthals. It is now known that the two species met and even mated, although 
the nature of their relationship in general is controversial. The theory that Homo 
Sapiens  violently eradicated the Neanderthals is currently doubted.  The Neanderthals 
existed for much longer than H omo Sapiens has, survived the ice age and exhibited 
many skills.  Art always thrives in cultural mixing pots.  
The Venus of Hohle Fels shows a range of entirely unique features as well as several 
characteristics  present in later female figur es. The Venus lacks a head. Instead , an off -
centered, but carefully carved ring is located above the broad shoulders of the figurine. This ring, despite being weathered, preserves polish suggesting that the figurine was 
worn as a pendant. Beneath the shoulders, which are roughly as thick as they are wide, 
large breasts project forward. The figurine has two short arms with two car efully 
carved hands with visible fingers resting on the upper part of the stomach below the 
breasts. 
The Venus has a short and squat form with a waist that is slightly narrower than the 
broad shoulders and wide hips. Multiple deeply incised horizontal lines cover the 
abdomen from the area below the breast to the pubic triangle. Several of these 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         203 
horizontal lines extend to the back of the figurine and are suggestive of clothing or a 
wrap of some sort. Microscopic images show that these incisions were created by 
repeatedly cutting along the same lines with sharp stone tools. The legs of the Venus 
are short and pointy. The breasts, buttocks and genitals are exaggerated and depicted 
in more detail. In addition to the many carefully modelled  anatomical features, the 
surface of the Venus preserves numerous lines and deliberate markings.  
Many of the features, including the emphasis on sexual attributes and lack of emphasis 
on the head, face and arms and legs, call to mind aspects of the numerous Venus 
figurines well known from the European Gravettien, which typically date between 
22,000 and 27, 000 years ago. The careful depiction of the hands is reminiscent of 
those of Venuses including that of the archetypal Venus of Willendorf, which was 
discovered in 1908. Despite the far greater age of the Venus of Hohle Fels, many of 
its attributes occur in various forms throughout the rich tradition of Paleolithic female representations. 
The figure, about 2.4 inches tall, was carved from a mammoth tusk.  The intricate 
detailing achieved with primitive stone tools indicates the amount of energy invest ed 
in these little objects— tens if not hundreds of hours.  
I viewed the origin al carving on my last trip to Tü bingen and was given a scale replica 
of it. I decided to create a larger version to see the sculptural forms of the carving 
more clearly, abstracting from the intentional scratching of the surface as well as the 
cracks from assembling the many pieces of th e original find.  
As I worked on the piece, I was impressed at the elegant abstraction of the human 
female form as well as its capture of the maternal stance of the pregnant woman. Early 
humans  during the Ice Age clearly had perception, empathy, concern and 
craftsmanship  that would rival that of contemporary people.

Friends  had commissioned me to make a sculpture for them and I thought for some 
time about doing a sculpture of a bird, since they loved birds, particularly owls. One 
day, browsing through pictures I had taken of pre -Columbian sculptures in a museum 
in Ecuador in  2013, I came upon my favorite of the collection and started to research 
it on the Web.  
Here is the photo I took —as well as a collection of other Valdivian stone sculptures : 
    
This carving is one of the earliest known sculptures in the Americas, a Valdivian stone 
carving from Ecuador. Valdivian stone figures are rectangular in shape with delineated 
eyes and features in characteristic minimalist style.  
The Valdivia Culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula 
near the modern -day town of Valdivia, Ecuador, between 3500 BC and 1800 BC.  
First, I carved a sculpture based on the Valdivian owl for my friends. I liked it so 
much, I made another one for my own collection, perched on a branch.  
The Cycladic Figure 
In 2015, I carved a sculpture based on early ancient Greek Cycladic sculpture. The 
wood is English Plane (related to sycamore) from a large tree we had taken down in 
our back yard a couple of years earlier . It was one of several logs that I had the arborist 
cut from the tree before removing the rest by crane. I started carving the log, based 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         206 
on a small copy of a Cycladic sculpture that I had purchased in Greece. During two 
visits, Rusty  assisted in the carving.  
Because my sculpture is based on the Greek marble Cycladic sculptures from the birth of Western sculpture and because of their connection with fertility, I named my 
sculpture “Baby” and dedicated it to Rusty and Sarah's daughter, my second 
granddaughter , Ruby, upon her birth.  
It was at first difficult to achieve the three -dimensional symmetrical form of the 
model. In addition, the quality of the wood see med ragged, so I wondered if I w ould 
be able to get a nice surface or reveal an interesting grain. It was not until the piece 
was completed and oiled that the beauty of the wood was revealed.  
   
The original Cycladic sculptures date back to the Neolithic era of pre -history, between 
5000 BCE and 2400 BCE. They were carved in the finest Greek marble, which is local 
to the Cycladic islands and was later exported to Athens and elsewhere in classical 
Greek times. Little is known about the Cycladic people and their world, although the 
group of islands was a crossroads of the Mediterranean even before sailing ships were 
invented.  
The Cycladic sculptures were likely fertility objects. Most of them represented young 
women of childbearing  age and accentuated their female features. Certainly, they 
involved the life cycle, and are often found in graves.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         207 
   
The Cycladic sculptures all possess certain features: canonical (e.g., folded arms), 
proportional and simplistic. They appear in museums now as pure in their whiteness. 
However, these sculptures were frequently painted. Pigments were used to add detail. 
The only facial feature carved was the nose. The sculptures have all been excavated at 
Cycladic cemeteries.  
The Neolithic and Bronze Age Cycladic figures present an intriguing link between 
prehistoric art and Western art; between the figurines of Galgenburg and Willendorf 
and the sculptures of Brancusi and Modigliani. As Lord Colin Renfrew states of these 
sculptures , “a handsome standing figure, with quiet, unassertive rhythms and balanced 
proportions, achieves one of the most compelling early statements of the human 
form. ”  
 
Is it that there is something incredibly modern about these prehistoric figurine  
sculptures, or has humankind always portrayed the human form in a manner that 
utilizes elegance and simplicity, with figures mastered by style and yet full of life? The 
emotional pitch is achieved by the omissions, distortions and exaggerati ons, and in so 
doing the artist  creates  a tension between the abstract and the real.  
The Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens —a favorite of mine —is dedicated to the 
study and promotion of ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, with special emphasis on Cycladic Art of the fifth millennium BC. It was founded in 1986. Its 
collection is one of the finest collections of Cycladic artifacts in the world.

The Cycladic Islands of Greece are set in the Aegean Sea. The ancient Greeks called 
these islands the Kyklades, a scattered kyklos or circle, of islands around the holy island 
and sanctuary of Apollo: Delos. The Cyclades had rich mineral deposits  and fine 
marble . They were close to each other, which made safe navigation between the 
islands in rowboats easy (sailing ships were only invented ca. 2000 BC). During the 
Early Bronze Age, when people started using bronze for their tools and weapons, a 
sophisticate d culture flourished in the Cyclades that thrived for almost a millennium. 
This period —called Early Cycladic —ranges from 3200 to 2000 BC.  
The Early Bronze Age inhabitants of the Cyclades used their local supplies of premier 
white marble to make both figurines and a variety of stone vases. The development 
of sculpture was one of the most impressive achievements of the Early Cycladic 
culture , no doubt made possible by marble and bronze technolog ies. Archaeologists 
organize the well -known stylized marble figurines in two basic types: schematic and 
naturalistic. The majority of Cycladic figurines represent nude females in standing 
position. Less frequent are models of male musicians, warriors and grou ps of figures 
in a range of postures.  
I took these photos at the Museum during May 2010, when we went on a wonderful  
cruise of the Cycladic Islands to celebrate my 65th birthday:

Pre-Columbian Sculpture  
I have always loved pre -Columbian sculptures and figures —at least since my family 
trip to Mexico when I was 1 7. The Olmec, Maya, Inca  and Aztec cultures all had 
wonderful pottery, masks and carvings.  
The ancient Olmec culture specialized in large stone carvings, which are relatively 
rare. I saw some near Vera Cruz on my honeymoon in 1989 and more during a trip 
to Guatemala in 2014 . The Mayans, Incans and Aztecs  had their pyramid temples with 
relief carvings , stone carvings and pottery incorporating striking images of gods and 
animals.  
Over a dozen Mayan and Aztec sculptures named Chacmool  have been found , dating 
from 800 AD on. The distinctive posture of the Chacmool is what allows the many 
sculptures to be united under one term: the figure reclines on his back, his knees bent 
and his body on a single axis from neck to toes. The elbows rest on the ground and 
support the torso, creating tension as the figure strains to  sit upright. The hands meet 
at the chest, usually holding either a disk  or a vessel, possibly for human sacrificial 
hearts . The head rotates ninety degrees from the axis of the body to present a frontal 
face. This recumbent position represents the antithesis of aggression: it is helpless and 
almost defenseless, humble and acquiescent .

Modern Sculpture  
Brancusi Simplicity 
Constantin  Brancusi (1876 -1957) is the modern ist sculptor who reduced forms to 
their simplest essence. Born in Romania (where my paternal grandparents came from), 
Brancusi was active in Paris during the blossoming of abstract art, partially inspired 
by exotic sculpture of prehistoric and non -European cul tures. 
Throughout my life, I often visited the room in the Philadelphia Museum of Art 
dedicated to Brancusi’s sculptures. I also lingered in Brancusi’s studio, recreated in 
Paris. In particular, I loved the purity and sophistication of Brancusi’s “ Bird in Flight” 
sculpture, which he produced in several media.  
             
Brancusi’s marble sculpture in his atelier, my oak sculpture in Rusty’s living room . 
To reawaken my sculpting after several years of non -use, I challenged myself to 
reproduce “ Bird in Flight” in wood, using a curved white oak limb from a tree in my 

Works of 3 -D Form

Philadelphia woodland. I later decided to do a larger version for outside my house in 
Chatham, from a wild cherry limb from my woodlands there.  When I thought about 
teaching a class in ceramic sculpture, I tried modeling Brancusi’s  “Bird in Space ” in 
clay. 
           
Moore Forms 
Henry Moore (1898 -1986) has always been my primary inspiration in sculpture. His 
sculptures have allowed me to see and feel 3 -D form s. 
I have looked carefully at Moore’s sculptures whenever I came across them and have 
run my hands as well as my eyes over their surfaces, textures, curves and edges. I have 
read many books about his sculpture, which mainly involves looking at the pictures , 
which try to capture the 3 -D sculptures in 2 -D photos.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         213 
 
Moore went beyond Brancusi by adding back some of the complexity of organic 3 -D 
forms, while retaining the clarity of the simple underlying forms. 
Moore was one of the pioneers of direct carving (as opposed to the academy’s use of 
pointing tools to mechanically copy models). He was also one of the first sculptors to 
explore holes or negative spaces in sculpture —whether leaving open space between 
forms or actually poking holes in solid masses.  
I have always adopted direct carving and been interested in negative space. I am 
exploring how to go beyond Moore’s holes to open up masses even more, using 
intersecting negative spaces and defining negative spaces with partially surrounding 
positive forms . 
I was long intrigued by a maquette of Moore’s with two holes that looked like eyes in a face. I only knew it from a small photo from one view of it. When I created a ceramic 
sculpture (Eyes Opened Up ) to explore how his piece worked in 3 -D, I ended opening 
up the top to get behind the eyes and then opening up much of the lower body to replace a solid form supporting the piece with a set of structural forms creating a more 
complex negative space below the face. I conceived this as transforming Moore’s 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         214 
“pocking simple holes” into outlining and defining negative spaces by opening up 
larger forms. 
Although Moore was primarily a stone carver, he did a number of wood sculptures. 
My approach to wood carving is quite similar to Moore’s —although of course not at 
his level of artistry and professionalism. Once established, Moore was also able to 
work at a much larger scale  than I can.  
Moore combined 3-D forms in various ways. Sometimes forms were combined to 
resemble human or animal organisms (i.e., structures consisting of multiple organs or 
functional forms). Some of his sculptures were large blocks with decorative or 
symbolic forms in relief on them. In other sculptures, massive forms were joined to 
each other by bone -like connectors. Eventually, Moore assembled forms that leaned 
on one another or stood in relation to each other— whether the forms were actually 
attached  or not.  
In some of my sculptures from 2020 -2022, I combine forms that are or appear to be 
from separate masses (e.g., different logs). In 3-Tiered Structure , for instance, forms 
carved in three different logs are stacked to create a complex of positive and negative 
forms. Perhaps this moves even further from Brancusi’s focus on individual forms 
than Moore moved in his pieces  with multiple interrelated forms.  In addition, my 
structures are studies of the “topology” (see below)  of the connections forming the 
positive  and negative spaces.  
Studies of Giacometti 
Sculptors generally make copies of works by their predecessors. Sometimes the goal 
is to reproduce the original faithfully, to some degree. Other times one adapts a pose 
or technique to a different subject. One can learn enormously by copying the masters. 
In previous times, students of sculpture learned through apprenticing an experienced 
artisan, working under their direction and being trained in their ways of seeing, 
planning, creating, reproducing and marketing sculpture. Copying interesting works 
is a w ay for students today to learn from a variety of experts, who are not personally 
available.  
In Spring 2019 after returning from a stay in Florida away from my studio, I re -
engaged in sculpting by studying the life and work of Giacometti . I read James Lord’s 
lengthy biography and looked at books of photos of his sculptures, which were mainly 
modeled  in clay or wax  and cast in plaster.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         215 
 
In quick succession, I copied several of Giacometti’s sculptures that appealed to me  
(see the section above on my “Giacometti Studies Series .” Most were from his early 
cubist period. I created each piece in clay and then made a rubber mold and cast it in 
plaster. I also fired the original clay version when possible.  
On the way to Florida, I had seen all Degas’ sculptures in the National Gallery in DC. 
So, I did a clay study of his Little Dancer , the only sculpture he displayed during his 
lifetime.

Topology of 3 -D Form  
“Topology” is the logos of topoi, which is Greek for the logical structure or study of 
places, which are spaces defined by materials, such as the surfaces of 3 -D objects. 
There is a field of mathematics devoted to formalizing topology. Euclid had already 
studied regular 3 -D polyhedrons, such as the cone, pyramid, globe and the five 
Platonic solids.  
 
The five Platonic solids.  
For modern topology, these are all topologically identical in that they have a continuous surface separating an inside from an outside. A donut shape, for instance, 
is different, because its surface could not be stretched to form one of the Platonic 
solids  without somehow tearing the surface. I do not find the regular solids very 
interesting sculpturally, except perhaps as bases for stretching into twisted and 
asymmetric forms.  
A simple topological trick is represented by the Möbius Strip sculpture. A Möbius strip 
is a 2 -D band that has its two ends attached following a half twist. A simple band—
either lying flat or with ends attached without the twist —has two sides: a top and 
bottom or inside and outside. However, with the twist, it only has one side! If you  run 
your finger along one side, you end up on what looks like the other side before 
returning to where you started.   
A more obscure trick is represented by the Klein Bottle sculpture. A Klein bottle is a 
bottle shape whose neck is elongated, enters the jar through some fourth dimension, 
passes through the bottle and then flares out to form the body of the bottle. If you 
start at some point on what appears to be the inside su rface of the bottle and move 
along that surface and out the neck, you can come around to what appears to be the 
outside surface of the bottle. Of course, the 3 -D representation of a 4 -D Klein bottle 
requires some artistic liberty.

A Möbius strip and a Klein bottle  
Sculpture in the real world is neither 2 -D nor 4 -D, but has an inside (the wood or 
clay) and an outside (the oiled or glazed surface). However, if the sculpture has been 
opened up with negative spaces or surrounded holes, it can have different topological 
structures. For instance, some of my sculptures have zero, one, two or more holes —
making their topological structures mutually incommensurable. Furthermore, sculptures like Mrs. Mayo  and Three -Tiered Structure  have holes that interconnect, 
forming relative ly complex topologies. 
Sculpture, as the working of physical materials in the world, is conditioned by 
structural needs for strength and balance in order to persist and be displayed. The act 
of opening up a piece with significant holes must take these needs into account.  
It is interesting that the Angel of Progress  sculpture, as it winds up from its base, 
maintains two vertical supports at each of three stages. The two vertical supports flow 
out of the horizontal stage below and into the horizontal stage above. At each level, 
the two verticals and two horizontals fo rm a circle framing the hole that is opened up 
there. The three topologically distinct openings are located at angles above each other, together defining an imaginary vertical negative space where the core of the  log had 
been. Maintaining a pair of supports at each stage provides for strength and balance of the overall sculpture, which is delicately balanced and which takes advantage of the 
strength of the log’s vertical fibers. If any one of these verticals were removed, the 
weight of the upper part of the sculpture would produce a destabilizing torque, threatening breakage or collapse.  
The Pod sculpture, by comparison, has three verticals at each stage  (not clearly visible 
in any one 2 -D photo) , providing a considerably more stable structure. The Pod 
features three faces working collaboratively. The support for these faces spirals down 
through various forms, consolidating in three columns from the upper half of the 
sculpture that sit atop three columns from the bottom half. The bottom rests again 
on three legs. Maintaining a trio of support at each vertical level provides for 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         218 
substantial stability, avoiding the careful maintenance of balance needed in the Angel 
of Progress . This allows the Pod to support heavier, more massive forms.  
      
     
Details of Pod illustrating tripod support structure and geometric elements.  
The Three -Tiered Structure moves from five supports at the floor, to four 
connections between Tier #1 and Tier #2, to three connections between Tier #2 and 
Tier #3, to a single arch at the top rising from its two  legs. A variety of openings are 
formed by these supports and the forms they flow into. 
In a contrasting approach, the Hickory Bivalve  is balanced on a small central base. This 
sculptural trick makes the sculpture seem to float without support. This requires a 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         219 
strong hidden bolt anchoring the sculpture to a broad base. Similarly, Saddle Curve  is 
balanced on a single narrow support. However, in this case the sculpture was designed 
with a strong sense of internal balance. The sculpture has no separate base, but stands 
on a broad, three- toed foot that is integral to the design. The support sectio n is a 
sculptural curve, a twisting 3 -D parabolic form. The surface of the top -heavy upper 
part is a saddle curve, a topologically significant 2 -D manifold . The saddle point —
near the center of the log’s grain pattern —is a local high point in one direction and a 
low point in the perpendicular direction, like a horse -riding saddle that slopes up in 
the front and back of the rider and slopes down on the sides under the legs. In calculus terms, a saddle point is simultaneously a rela tive maximum and minimum. In the 
sculpture, this surface is used to display the visually interesting grain that evolved at 
the base of the cherry tree, just above root ground level. To accomplish this,  the log 
was flipped wide side up, requiring a supporting form that would provide adequate 
stability.

saddle curve of Saddle Curve .  
Sculptures with more complex topological structures may include interconnected 
openings. An early attempt at this was my Hermaphrodite. It has two vertical supports 
forming an elongated opening, which are then connected to an opening from above. 
Bite of the Apple  adds another opening, so that holes from four of the six perpendicular 
axes meet in the thereby opened up center of the piece. Similarly, Return of the Osprey  
has four openings that join in the middle of the log. Sly Eye has two openings defining 
the spiraling middle area of the rear of the piece entering into a cavernous opening of 
the wood’s mass from the front. Mrs. Mayo  features a more involved set of openings, 
including some largely hidden holes down the center, linking multiple openings. The inside/outside relations of Hinged Forms  are rather ambiguous, depending on whether 
the hinge is open or not; they can be seen as reducing the wood almost to an outline structure defining connected negative spaces, most notably the center of the log, for 
which opening the hinge provides easy access for the carving and the observation.  
The view of sculptural material as structures defining negative forms comes from my ceramic models and sculptures. See the section on my Negative Structures Series, 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         220 
featuring the following: Slab Sculpture 1, Slab Sculpture 2, Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture with 
Grog and Negative Structure.  Here, the interconnected openings are too involved to 
easily count or describe. The approach shifts from opening up a solid mass to creating 
open space s by defining their boundaries.  
At the end of 2021, I returned to sculpting after taking a break to complete some 
publications. I decided to extend my topological exploration of sculptural structures 
with a three -tiered wood sculpture. I began with a series  of clay maquettes to get a 
feel for appropriate 3-D forms and connecting structures. I explored possible 
structures in clay for a couple of months. I then carved three logs from a large local 
pine tree that had been knocked down a few years earlier by a hurricane. The final 
structure r ises through 4, 3, 2 and then 1 upright structures. A number of distinct 3 -
D forms are connected by a network of structures and negative spaces.  The wooden 
forms differ from the clay forms, but incorporate structural understandings that I 
gained from the ceramic maquettes.  
Working in clay —such as the maquettes —involves different gravitational— and 
hence topological —considerations than carving wood. The clay must  hold its own 
weight as it dries and is fired, as well as balance properly as a finished piece. Clay 
structures are built up, whereas wood is carved away. So extreme opening up of 
negative spaces by reducing positive forms to a minimum involves adding clay  until 
it is strong enough versus removing wood without making it too fragile to withstand 
checking during drying or breaking under stress. Ceramic sculptures can be built up 
from spans of clay coils or elongated slabs, whereas wood sculptures are carved o ut 
from solid logs. Although the results are often quite different, I often create ceramic 
models that I can hold in my hand, easily view in 3 -D and quickly refine their masses, 
openings or connections. Such maquettes then inspire and guide the creation of  wood 
sculptures requiring a hundred  times as much time and effort. In this way, topological 
insights from one medium influence work in the other material. This is an important aspect of the dialectic between material and manipulation in sculpture.  
Sculptural topology —the structural logic of 3 -D form in matter like clay or wood —
contrasts with mathematical topology or geometry, although there are linkages between them. For instance, Pod and Saddle  Curve  incorporate lines, circles, triangles 
and curves, incorporating them however in masses that flow into one another in 
organic rather than mechanical or stylized ways. Mathematical and industrial figures 
are abstractions from physical objects; sculpture makes visible what is lost in such 
abstraction.

5. Space: Opening Up 3-D Form 
As discussed in the following chapter  on my sculpting techniques —as well as in the 
section on “Negative S tructures  Series” in the second chapter , above —a frequent  goal 
of my carving or modeling is to open up the material. The aim may be partially to 
supply  views into the heart of the mass —revealing swirling grains in heartwood, for 
instance. It may also offer a view of the internal structure, such as supports in clay or 
plaster pieces. Furthermore, it adds considerable complexity, asymmetry and 
formation to  the sculpture. Thereby, it suggests and invites more ways to observe the 
piece visually and tactually.

However, the primary effect of opening up a mass is on the space of the piece: the space around the piece and the spaces within the piece:  
Space is the place  
in which sculpture opens up.

In sculpture, the term “negative space” is often used to specify how a hole in a 
sculptural mass can be viewed as itself having a form —the negation of the form of 
the mass. Wittgenstein illustrated the phenomenon of “seeing as” either positive or 
negative spaces in simple drawings:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         223 
 
Faces/vase drawing. The white positive space of the vase creates a black negative space of 
two faces looking at each other. By shifting v isual focus, you can see it in either one way or 
the other. 
In a sculpture, one can simply poke a hole, opening the mass with a negative space, 
or one can fashion the opening as an interesting interior form. The inner negative 
space can be integrated with the surrounding exterior negative space, so that the 
positiv e space of the sculpture’s surface flows from its outside into its interior.  
 
Holes . Red clay and paint. 2017. Based on a stone sculpture by Barbara Heppenworth, a 
contemporary of Henry Moore. This was a simple attempt by me   at creating  several holes 
in a cylindrical form and letting their spaces merge inside.  
Moore, Heppenworth  and others started by poking holes and then enlarging them 
into negative forms. I sometimes try to take this further, so that the positive and 
negative forms become equally important aspects of the sculpture. One can then view 
the sculpture as consisting primarily of open spaces defined by positive forms. The 
forms of the spaces then become paramount. For instance, there can by multiple open 
forms, flowing into each other, partially contained by positive forms.

The concern with opening up sculpture has evolved during my years sculpting. My 
first wood sculpture, Gelassenheit , did not open the original log at all, but let it be, and 
followed the lines of the log, simply defining interesting flowing contours that brought out the colorful grain of the black walnut. The next one, Twisted Sister, defined a 
negative space between i ts spiraling legs. Two natural holes from knots in the wood 
provided negative spaces like eyes.  
Then I did a plaster sculpture that was quite open, structured by chicken wire framing 
holding the plaster, which was soaked on rags. This piece not only had two short legs 
with space between them, but many openings that flowed from the exterior into the 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         225 
interior. The inside was structured with ropes to add interest to the inside, like nerves 
within a body  or brain. The openings from the outside merged into this complex 
internal space.

Some 15 years later, I carved the Owl of Minerva. Again, it had two shapely legs defining 
a 3-D negative space that twisted between them. It also had an open form that defined 
the owl’s wooden beak and poked through the back of the head to suggest an eye.   
    
Below, where I discuss how I carve the Open Cherry Trunk and Upright Cherry Figure , 
one can see the process of gradually opening up a log to create a unity of positive and 
negative spaces.

My most open wood sculpture is Mrs. Mayo . I discuss in the following chapter that I 
purchased new tools and developed a new approach to carve this sculpture. The 
Hickory Bivalve , which preceded this carving, was also opened up extensively. In 
particular, the openings in Mrs. Mayo  interweave and permeate the piece. The positive 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         228 
forms that remain can be “seen as” largely containment structures that define the 
boundary between interior and exterior spaces.

After opening up these wood sculptures, I decided to try creating ceramic sculptures 
that also open spaces. I thought it might be easier to create internal spaces using clay.

In modeling with clay, one can build up structures, as opposed to carving out openings 
in solid material. This can provide more flexibility and access to explore the formation 
of negative spaces. My first attempts at this were Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2 , Slab 
Structure 3, Sculpture with Grog and Negative Structur e.

These abstract ceramic explorations influenced my subsequent wood sculptures. I 
first modeled quick clay maquettes to try out approaches in 3 -D to opening up the 
logs. Following are some of these studies:

A special approach to opening up space used the Klein Bottle from topological 
mathematics. It is a 4- D closed manifold that has no differentiation of interior and 
exterior. I created a 3 -D representation using clay coils.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         240 
 
There are some auxiliary windows to allow one to look inside, but they do not belong 
to the Klein Bottle. The large round hole facing dow n in the front is the opening of 
the tube that comes out the top, circles around, enters the main bottle at the back and then opens out the front. (The way the tube enters at the back is topologically illegal 
in 3-D, but takes artist’s license to account for only being able to create 3 -D forms in 
this world.) If you start from a point “inside” the bottle, you can proceed up the tube, 
around and out the front into the “outside” without crossing any surface, so that 
inside and outside are the same continuous space .  
The trick in opening up the inside this way is that the tube actually does penetrate the 
surface of the bottle in the back. In 4 -D it could enter without breaking the surface, 
in analogy with the Mobius Strip, which is a 2- D manifold that only has one surf ace 
in 3-D space. (See my ceramic Mobius Strip .)

6. Pr actice:  Sculpting 3-D Form in 
Wood  
Tools and Techniques  
I generally start with a log and a challenge. The two go together. For instance, if my 
challenge is to create a wooden sculpture that recreates some of the form of Brancusi’s 
Bird in Flight , then I need a log or branch that is long, thin and curved at one point. 
Perhaps the log comes first and suggests the challenge. Alternatively, t he log may 
contain the shape of a human head or a body with two or four legs.  
I like to create large sculptures  (almost on the scale of the human body) , so one can 
see and feel the forms easily. For practical purposes , I am limited to logs that are small 
enough and light enough for me to move around, perhaps with a hand truck, a lever 
or a friend.  
From my first wood sculpture to my last, I have used the  same tools to shape the 
form —literally the same physical large gouge and mallet. The gouge chips away 
chunks of wood about one square inch across and curved below. Hundreds of these 
gouge cuts provide the rough surfaces of the sculpture. I then use a foot -long 
Sureform rasp to smooth out the gouge marks and to create my characteristic long 
flowing curves. Typically, one form on the sculpture flows into another along curves 
refined by this rasp. Each o f the major forms in the sculpture is asymmetric, looking 
unexpectedly different from each angle of observation.  
If one looks at a sculpture as it is literally “taking shape” as an organism (an 
assemblage of multiple organ -like 3 -D forms), then the question arises of how to join 
the distinct forms together. This question is partially answered in the technical process  
of refining and smoothing the individual forms and the transitions between them. The 
rasp helps to define smoothly flowing, minimalist transitions between them like those 
found in bones and animal bodies.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         242 
   
My original mallet, gouge and rasp. Hand carving tools, including rifflers.  
Once the sculpture is well defined by the gouge and the rasp, the surfaces are refined 
to feel silky smooth to the touch, almost like skin. This is accompl ished with smaller 
rasps or riff lers—to get into the tight spots where the Sureform cannot reach —and 
by sandpaper. I typically use 4 or 5 successive grades of sandpaper, from very rough  
50-grade to super smooth 300 -grade wet -and dry. The final sanding is interspersed 
with oiling.  
I have always finished my sculptures with Tung oil. I used to mix my own Tung oil 
and boiled linseed oil, but now I use a commercial Wetlox blend, which works well  
for all wood surfaces . I give the sculpture at least three or four coats of oil, rubbed 
with the wet sandpaper. Sometimes, a sculpture can use another coat of oil after a 
year. 
 
My electric tools: chains aw, drill, belt sander and rout er. 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         243 
Gradually, I have begun to use electric tools to rough in and help shape the logs. For 
instance, in creating Mrs. Mayo , I wanted to open up the log and have interconnected 
opening s going throughout the scul pture. First, I created clay ma quettes or models of 
the log with various openings. In particular, my challenge was to rough in the 
sculpture with a chain saw, which can only cut long, straight cuts. I bought a chain 
saw that would be safe for sculpting. I also got a strong hand drill wi th large bits for 
drilling long or wide holes.  
   
Model s of Mrs. Mayo , featuring openings for chainsaw cuts. Holes drilled in base and leg of 
Mrs. Mayo  sculpture.  
A technical reason for wanting to open up the whole structure of Mrs. Mayo  was that 
the wood was still green, as the tree had just been felled. I started carving  right away, 
rather than waiting five to ten years for the wood to gradually dry from the inside out. 
Opening the log up so that no part was more than three or four inches thick reduced 
the chances of the wood splitting or checking as it dried and shrank f rom the outside. 
Although there was some checking while I carved the piece, it stopped as soon as I 
oiled it to seal the outside. Thus, the opening up process combined aesthetic, technical 
and practical issues of form, tools and materials.

Holes drilled for eyes. Hole (see light circle in center) drilled from middle of sculpture down 
to legs. 
Now I work in a studio  in my basement  that combines a carpentry workshop with a 
wood sculpture studio and a clay studio. As the need arises, I clear out an area to make 
a workspace for wood, clay, plaster, molds or photography.  
For many years, I have used a jigsaw, a belt sander and a router for creating sculpture 
bases and for doing some of the smoothing work on sculptures. Now, I can fluidly 
combine tools and techniques from carpentry, sculpture and ceramics.  
   
The ceramic and carpentry sections of my workshop . 
I often create small clay models of sculptures I have in mind. This is extraordinarily 
useful in getting a feel for the 3 -D forms, which are impossible to imagine in one ’s 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         245 
mind and to understand how the different perspectives fit together.  The human mind 
is shockingly weak at understanding 3 -D forms. Imagining complex sculptures 
without a good model is wickedly difficult, even with perspectival sketches or photos.  
For instance, I wanted to carve a log I had cut down specifically with a favorite wood 
sculpture by Moore in mind. I had several photos of the sculpture; even an entire 
book devoted to Moore’s process of creating that particular sculpture. However, I 
found it impossible to plan my carving until I made a rough plasticine clay model. Then I decided to make a larger, more accurate clay model using sculpting clay.  
 
Study of Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure: Holes . 
It was surprisingly difficult to get the different perspectives from multiple photos to 
meld together. I discovered a lot about the three -dimensionality of Moore’s sculpture 
from making the model. In particular, I learned about the positive and negative sp aces 
in the interior of this opened up form, significantly entitled Reclining Figure: Holes . 
In the end, after making several clay models, I concluded that the heavy log I had 
moved from Philadelphia to Chatham  was not appropriate for a figure like Moore’s. 
I rotated the log and began to open it up using all my tools to create interesting 
negative spaces and exterior forms. Eventually, it evolved into my final sculpture of 2019: Return of the Osprey . This was my most complex sculpture to date, with many 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         246 
positive and negative forms flowing in and out of each other.  (See section below on 
“Opening Up a Wood Log.”)

Creating a Set of Oak Sculptures  
It was a dark and stormy night in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, when I heard a loud 
crash in the middle of a torrential lightning storm. The next morning , I found that a 
large limb from a two -hundred -year-old oak tree had been flung by the storm against 
our garage wall and had smashed an open window to pieces. After I sawed up the 
heavy branch and dragged the logs off to our woodpile, it struck me that this  was a 
gift from heaven. I was just starting a sabbatical from teaching and the logs inspired me to make time now to return to my wood carving after a hiatus of more than a 
decade. 
  
It is usual to let wood dry out slowly , so it does not check and split. But I knew that 
dry oak would be hard to carve and that I could make much faster progress if I carved 
the wood while it was still green and then treated it carefully so that it would dry 
without checking. This worked amazin gly well. I carved the sculptures so that no 
volume would be too thick, so that outside layers would not dry out faster than 
interiors and cause strains. I was able to finish the carving before the freezing nights of winter came, and I oiled the sculptures well to prevent rapid drying and cracking.  
(I later learned that Moore had also become impatient with the years it would take to 
dry out the large tree trunk he had for his Reclining Figure: Holes . He took a similar 
approach of carving the green wood and protecting it from checking.)  
I mad e four sculptures from the oak and then went on to carve a more ambitious 
piece from a cherry tree log that a friend had brought me from his back yard in Illinois. The creation of these sculptures is documented here. 
The first sculpture I did was relatively simple, to ease me back into the process. I took  
as a goal  the elegant, elongated  form of Brancusi's Bird in Flight, which he had cast in 
metal. I challenged myself to see how well I could reproduce this from a log. Brancusi 
had reduced the image of a bird in flight to a simple, abstract, streamlined form. As I 
worked on it, I discovered the subtle complexity of his form and adapted it to the log 
I worked on, which I had selected for this project.

Sureform rasp, and (d) the final sanded and oiled sculpture.  
The next sculpture was also an upright form, but I wanted to open it up. In earlier  
pieces, I had found that a vertical opening could be formed as the pairing of two 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         249 
vertical masses  (like legs) , with the opening scooped out between them and defining 
them as separate forms. This time I added an opening from above, so that the negative 
form from above flows into the opening below. I tried to develop contrasting forms 
coming out the top to add to t he asymmetry of the piece —resulting in a vaguely 
male/female contrast, supported by a lower -leg-like femur structure.

Hermaphrodite . White o ak. Philadelphia. 2010.  
The third sculpture was based on the principle that a sculpture should be compact 
enough to roll down a hill without its parts breaking off. I started with a football shape 
that one could cuddle in one ’s lap, like a cat with its head stretching out to be rubbed. 
The concavity that opened the form without penetrating it was based on a water -
polished rock I found during my explorations at Lake Powell earlier that summer. I 
left the bottom rounded so that t he piece could be held, fondled, and then set down 
to rock and find its own center of gravity. The beak -like ending of the elongated neck 
gave the piece a strong resemblance to a Mexican duck sculpture that I always 
treasured .

The female form is always a favorite source of inspiration and sensuality. With the 
fourth piece of oak,  I tried to bring out sinuous twists of flowing masses, precariously 
balanced in motion.

Creating an Open Cherry Trunk  
My last sculpture of the year 2010 was more ambitious  than the four oak pieces . The 
log consisted of  the starts to  four branches , so I turned it upside down and used three 
of them for legs. Again, I wanted to open the wood up to get away from the simple 
log shape and to explore the interior of the cherry tree. I broke through two cavernous 
openings from the back and scooped out much of the mass in the front, behin d and 
below a prominent beak form that emerged from the fourth branch.  
The openings once more evolved from holes in the wood to spaces surrounding new 
positive forms defined by the negative spaces. They contributed to a spiraling motion 
that I used to animate the log. I then added decorative touches to enliven the piece further: a piercing eye next to the beak and a flowing channel to add to the spiral. The 
feet were given various pointed forms to lift the piece off its base. All of this emerged 
gradually as I worked on the wood and studied its development and its needs. Cherr y 
wood has a variety of structural details, which I tried to uncover and retain, from beautiful patterns just below the bark to interior crevices filled with sap  or resin .

Creating an Upright Cherry Figure  
In the summer of 2000, I attended a conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A friend 
had brought along  in his pickup truck a large  cherry wood limb from a tree in his back 
yard in Illinois. He intended to bring it to my home  in Boulder, Colorado,  since he 
knew I liked to carve wood. I helped him on the drive and we read about philosophical 
controversies involving intersubjectivity to pass the time. Fifteen years somehow 
passed until I both wrote an essay on intersubjectivity and carved the log.  
At some point during the intervening 15 years, I carved some of the middle area of 
the limb down to 4" x 4" to see what the heartwood looked like. I had thought about 
shaping the log in a bone form, like a femur with a ball -and-joint socket. When I lost 
weight, I thought of carving a long, thin image of myself. I probably considered other 
ideas, but never started on any of them.  
On September 28, 2015, I decided to start removing some areas of the log to begin 
to break away from the original log shape , which is still visible in the following  
pictures . Also visible are the cuts I made with a chainsaw to facilitate carving out the 
areas.

Over the next several days of carving, I roughed out the forms of the sculpture using 
my favorite large gouge and mallet. That was good exercise.

         256 
 
At this point, I had roughed in some of the bone form and the ball for the joint. 
However, the sculpture still looked too log -like and symmetrical to me. I felt a need 
to break through the solid log cylinder. This would also cut through levels of grain to 
the darkly colored heartwood, just as my carving had begun to do in various areas of 
the log. So , I drilled some starter holes with my electric drill and then gouged out a 
passageway through the cylinder. As I integrated this into the sculpture, twisting asymmetries began to evolve  and a larger variety of forms took shape, adding 
considerably to the interest of the scu lpture, without dest roying its unity.  
 
People sometimes ask if I have an image of the sculpture in my head before I start to 
work on it (the Platonic theory) or if I just let the image that is inherent in the log 
come to light ( Michelangelo’s  claim). It is really much more of an emergent process 
that takes place through the direct carving techniques I use. Certainly, I start with 
some ideas that I want to explore and I start with a log that has interesting potentials. 
But the interaction betwe en material and eye incorporates  these in a much more  subtle 
interaction. If one works from a model or from the nature of the log, then you have to wonder why that model  (and pose) or that particular log (and orientation) was 
selected; t here is generally some rough vision  at work, although it may be substantially 
transformed as it gets worked out and evolves through the various stages of 
development.  
Since I do not try to represent  or re- present  some model or objec t, I am free to 
explore, modify and  refine to achieve various goals. I am interested in defining 3 -D 
forms, which look quite different from alternative  vantage points and which guide the 
caressing hand. I turn the worked -on sculpture around frequently and feel the volume 
and flow of the contributing forms with my hands. I love the beauty of wood as an 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         257 
organic product of growth, so my carving explores its layers of grai n and its unique 
twists. I use  natural Tung wood oil as a finish to keep the wood alive and lustrous. It 
comes alive with the oiling and comes into its own final appearance. With periodic 
oiling, a wood sculpture can live indefinitely long, at least for centuries.  
Because of the organic nature of my sculpture and its constituent forms, the finished 
works often remind people of natural and even human figures. In part , this is because 
my forms and their interconnections tend to follow the laws of organic growth. They exhibit a massing, sense of materiality and sensuousness of form , which may feel 
familiar from objects in the world. The forms are  appealing to the eye and the touch , 
partly because they are both similar and, in certain ways, different from natural 
objects .  
It is interesting that my first two wood sculptures are particularly suggestive to many 
viewers. People often say Gelassenheit  looks like an elephant, although I avoided 
imposing any representative forms on that log. Rather, I tried to make the forms look and feel massive. I guess that elephants also have massive forms ( large head, powerful 
trunk, floppy ears, sturdy legs, lumbering body). And Twisted Sister always reminds 
people of ET, although the movie came out a couple of years after the sculpture was 
finished. Apparently, the degree of abstraction from the human figure is similar in the 
two figures —and the eyes of both are appealing . 
Sculpture is a unique art form in that it is three -dimensional. It not only fills and 
shapes space, but it creates a special space ( Heidegger's theory) in which it s event of 
“presencing ” unfolds. Whereas painting only suggests perspective and tricks  the eye, 
sculpture beckons the observer's body to interact and move around the piece, taking 
up infinite different physical perspectives on it. People  are much more oriented to 
sight than to any other sense for observing and understanding the world. Vision is two-dimensional, capturing only that side of objects that currently face us. Perhaps 
infants, who put things in their mouth to explore them, or blind people, who touch 
surfaces, have more of a 3 -D sense. However, it seems that the human brain is 
primarily wired (or trained) to understand 2 -D forms much better than 3 -D forms. 
Creating and experiencing sculpture may provide a corrective to this rather severe 
limitation. 
While impressionist painting began to display the materiality of light, paint and 
brushstroke, wood sculpture brings out the nature of the wood: its size, shape, weight 
and volume, but also its roughness (or smoothness) of surface and the unending 
complexity of its coloring and graining. The growth history of trees like oak an d cherry 
are intricate on many scales and they are captured in the cell structure and displayed in the grain of the sculptural surface.

After I roughed in the 3- D forms of the log, I used  a large rasp to remove the gouge 
marks and to refine the curving surfaces. All my wood sculptures have been created 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         259 
using the same basic tools and techniques. This gives a unity to my wood sculpture 
gallery— along with a diversity based on different tree species, sizes and shapes. My 
pieces have smooth flowing surfaces, in part due to the large rasp work.  
Rasping was followed by sanding. I started with #5 0 rough sandpaper to smooth the 
surfaces. And gradually worked up to #1000 very fine sandpaper as well as wet -and-
dry sandpaper and #0000 very fine steel wool to give the surface a smooth touch.

Finally, I oiled the wood with pure Tung oil. This brought out the incredible color of 
the cherry wood, which I had worked so hard to reveal as the forms cut across the 
multi -color bands of grain. I oiled the scu lpture each day for several days, rubbing it 
with a cloth and preparing for each coat with the steel wool.

The sculpture took about three weeks to create . Most days I worked on it for a couple 
of hours. 
After a sculpture is finished and displayed, it generally ripens in color or darkens over 
time. Cherry wood , in particular , develops a deep red tone that continues to mature 
for years.   
On November 3, I took the sculpture out in the back yard to get some sunshine.

Opening Up a n English Plane Log 
When we took down a towering English Plane tree leaning out over the koi pond and 
threatening our house in Philadelphia, I had the arborist save a log from a bend near 
the top of the trunk. I had in mind carving it based on a favorite Henry Moore 
sculpture  from a huge elm trunk, Reclining Figure: Holes . This was a complicated 
undertaking, so I put it off for almost a decade. Then I did a few clay models to understand the overall structure in 3-D, including the many  holes opening it up, which 
were important enough for Moore that he named  his piece accordingly.  
However, when I finally got up my nerve to tackle the log, I soon discovered that it 
would not work  as anything like Moore’s sculpture. So , I re-oriented the log upright 
and decided to just follow the lead of the evolving structure. I made some chainsaw 
cuts to define rough features and then I started to drill out s everal  openings through 
the log to open it up. I used approaches I had developed in working on smaller 
abstract ceramic sculptures. I then carved the openings of the holes to flow through 
the pie ce from the exterior curves and forms.  
As I worked on the log with my gouge, numerous 3- D forms emerged, intricately 
connected and leading in and out of the holes. On the top was a dramatic slab of wood, which I decided to carve into the head of an osprey, giving my sculpture the 
name “ Return of the Osprey .” 
Ospreys are graceful large raptor birds that are again becoming common on Cape 
Cod. In recent  decades, ospreys almost died out. DDT pesticides being used for 
farming and gardening were affecting the eggs of ospreys, so that most of the ir eggs 
broke prematurely. With the banning of DDT, the osprey population i s now returning 
from the brink of human -caused extinction. I celebrate  their return with my sculpture, 
recognizing one instance in which people reversed their ecologically destructive 
practices in time to do some good.  
This sculpture turned out to be one of my largest (and heaviest), as well as my most 
complex works. The opening up of the log involves large and interconnected 
passageways, most of which flow into the surrounding outer curves and forms. While 
the overall s hape of the piece may portray an upright bird perched on its nest, with 
sharp beak ready for fishing, the details require running one ’s fingers along individual 
transitions between forms and peering into the interior from different angles in 
diverse lighti ng. It takes time and effort to understand the sculpture. 
Because of its skewed balance and considerable mass, the sculpture is bolted to a 
heavy base, carved from an oak cross- section gifted by Holly in Maine, via an oak 
board attached to the sculpture’s bottom.

Creating an Angel in Space  
After returning from Florida at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I sheltered in my 
basement studio and focused on casting ceramic sculptures. Then I spent August 
carving the trunk of a cherry tree that Alan and Bill had cut down and saved for me.  
I started by roughing the log in with a chainsaw, guided by a 10" clay model. This 
allowed me to remove large masses of the cylindrical log to start to define a structure 
of limbs spiraling up from a base, as well as to poke through a series of interconnected 
openings going completely through the log. Prominent features  of the angel were also 
roughed in: head, chest, abdomen.

The wings are an add -on from a board. This was suggested by totem  poles from the 
Northwest, which attach wings to thunderbirds. The base is a rough log from a pine 
tree that was downed at a neighbor’s house during a hurricane. I cut chunks of the 
large pine trunk and trimmed one down for this base, which is entirely shaped by the 
chainsaw. The base was needed to raise the angel and to stabilize its potent ially top -
heavy mass.  
 
The theme, Angel of Progress, comes from Walter Benjamin’s 9th Thesis on the 
Philosophy of History:  
“A Klee painting named ‘Angelus Novus’ shows an angel looking as though 
he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His 
eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one 
pictures the angel of history. His fa ce is turned toward the past. Where we 
perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, 
awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is 
blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence 
that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him 
into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before 
him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. ” 
In 1940, when fascism enveloped Europe, eventually leaving him no escape but 
suicide, Benjamin wrote this set of theses, questioning the Marxist optimism about 
historical progress. The “Angel of the New” is caught in a chaotic storm, which 
prevents a forwa rd-looking view and dumps an ever- growing pile of debris at his feet.

In the apotheosis of governmental lawlessness, unrestrained health pandemic, 
potential financial collapse, increasing economic inequality, ideological division and 
impending climate change, it seemed to me time to ponder an angel of progress again. 
My newer angel is inscrutable, looking neither forward nor backward, expressing 
neither hope nor redemption, blankly hovering amidst whatever may come or go  or 
pile up . The winds blow through her, and she persists with the solid material of wood 
that lives on aft er its trees are gone.  
      
Like my other recent wood sculptures, I aimed to open up space and escape the solid, symmetric cylindrical form of the original log. In particular, I built upon the approach 
to multiple intersecting openings in Mrs. Mayo  and Return of the Osprey . While the foot 
of the sculpture retains the circumference of the log, the base it sits on extends outside to broaden the space somewhat. The wings reach out even much further, to open , 
define and pierce  a larger encompassing space, without pretending to be an entir ely 
integral part of the original log. 
The negative forms of the openings and of the cutaways that lead to them define 
positive structural limbs that support the angel -like legs, spiraling around a central 
hollow. The forms of these legs result largely from the studies of structure in my abstract ceramic sculptures. As indications of structure, the positive forms of the 
lower part of the sculpture indicate or outline the  angel’s hips and legs, while removing 
their gravitational mass and allowing the body to flow lightly around and to suspend 
the figure almost in flight.

The forms that enclose the central openings of the lower half of the angel are masses 
designed to reveal the power and beauty of the cherry wood. Note, for instance, how 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         273 
thin some of the joints are where structures merge into each other. The curves and 
angles of these forms are designed to bring out the grain of the log, which grows in 
concentric rings following the vertical of the log. To expose interesting grain patterns , 
one must cut into the log and even across the log (as atop the head).

Con-Struction in M useum  of Art  Exhibit 
Sculpture accepted for the international juried exhibit “In Tandem” at the Cape Cod 
Museum of Art, May 10 - July 30, 2023.  
“Con -Struction .” Sculpture from a single cooper beech tree log, on sycamore base. Created in 
Chatham, MA, January 2023. Base: 11”x 18”, height: 18”. Log found by Tom Getz. Carved as 
five separate forms and mounted in tandem.  
 
The title “Con -Struction” combines the Latin terms for “with” and “fitting together.” 
The five constituent forms of the sculpture fit together with each other to produce a 
composite structure. They work with each other in tandem, becoming individually 
subordinate to the piece as a con -structed unit. While each of the five individual forms 
has some complexity of shape and often includes a small central opening, the sculpture as a whole has many times the complexity and opens up significantly more 
interior space. The whole is greater than the sum of its  parts due to the physical and 
spatial connections through which the parts fit together.  
Since 1976, I have carved wood sculptures with biomorphic or organic three -
dimensional forms, which contrast with the geometric shapes of manufactured 
commodities. Their embodied forms are nuanced and asymmetrical; they present 
different, often surprising views from alternative perspectives. By cutting across the 
growth pattern of the tree, I strive to bring out lively grain patterns. Finishing smooth curves and surfaces with natural wood oil, I revive and preserve the life of the wood. 
In a piece like Con -Struction, the organic parts work in tandem to form an organism, 
which cannot be reduced to the functioning of its individual parts.  
I have increasingly endeavored to “open up” the material of my sculptures during my 
focus on ceramic and wood sculpture since retiring to Cape Cod in 2015. When 
working on logs, this involves piercing into the core wood and creating interior spaces. 
The negative space s of the openings become equally important sculptural forms. They 
allow light and sight to flow into and through the usually opaque volumes. Often, cavernous spaces are created, stimulating primordial images of shelter and endowing 
abstract 3 -D space with elemental form, complex structure and human meaning.  
Con-Struction is the latest in a series of wood sculptures where I have opened up the 
log from a tree by sawing it into two to five segments. I then carved the individual 
segments separately, allowing me easier access to internal areas and facilitating the  
effort of creating negative volumes. In order to maintain a view of how the parts will 
work in tandem, I generally develop a ceramic maquette of the overall intended 
design, working out the positive and negative spaces and relationships for the 
assembled final piece. The specific forms and eventual surfaces of the wood emerge 
largely through  the work of carving, so the finished wood sculpture differs 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         275 
significantly in detail from the ceramic maquette. However, the approach to opening 
up the material and the way the parts work together, abutting each other and framing 
negative spaces, persist  from the conceptual model to the finished product. 
The primary tandem relationship is that of sculptor to sculpture. The sculptor’s 
experienced hand and eye respond to intimate perceptions of the evolving materials and work. Even for someone who has worked extensively in 3 -D, it is challenging to 
plan, visualize and work in the round. Human understanding is primarily formed through 2 -D experiences of visual perception. Thinking deeply about a complex 
object from multiple perspectives requires prolonged interaction with the object as it emerges from its raw materials  ... and even living with the sculpture after it is finished.  
Such interaction builds upon  experience in the many stages of crafting sculpture and 
upon experiments with series of attempts at related aims. Con -Struction benefits from  
my previous carvings that investigated biomorphic form, opening up solids, creating negative space and dividing a log into multiple pieces that work in tandem.

Introduction  
his volume of my assembled works differs from the other volumes of my 
eLibrary in multiple  ways. It does not present writings from my academic 
career but  displays artifacts that I created either as an escape from professional  
labors or following my retirement from academia. Rather than describing the design 
of immaterial software or theories, it  presents  photographs of and comments about 
physical objects —mostly sculptures —which  I fashioned out of materials like wood 
and clay.  
There are chapters on the following aesthetic creations  and approaches : 
1. My wood sculptures from 1976 to the present . Wood sculpture has been my primary 
artistic endeavor during my adult life. Every few years, I did a couple pieces. 
In retirement, I have been more productive. 
2. Clay sculptures and pottery from 1970 to the present . As a young child, my mother 
taught me basic pottery. I enjoyed occasionally working in clay in my 20s and 
always looked forward to doing more. I felt that the medium of abstract clay 
sculpture had much more potential than was represented in the art world, 
even though  clay may be considered one of the oldest surviving artistic medi a 
in the world. The universality of clay work may be attributed to its 
combination of utility and beauty. Retirement has allowed me to explore 
ceramic sculpture in my own studio as well as to take pottery lessons at local art centers.  
3. My houses, which I helped to design  with Carol in Philadelphia, Boulder, 
Philadelphia and Chatham in about 1978, 1997, 2004 and 2015. Having 
designed the Chatham  house incorporating many species of wood , I was 
eager to create wooden furniture to go with the house. The house was designed in 2014/15 and built in 2015/16. I constructed  the furniture in 
2016/17,  and the house was landscaped at that time as well. In 2017/18, I 
turned my basement furniture shop into a productive sculpture studio.  
4. Reflections  on organic form from nature . I strive to create asymmetrical, flowing, 
sensuous, organic forms whose structures are often inspired from human 
forms, animal shapes and other organisms or natural objects . Living by the 
ocean, I have sculpt ed some forms that I fou nd on the beach.  I am fascinated 
with the sophistication of sculptures dating back far into pre -history. I have 
made a few  sculptures based on such works , as well as studies of modern 
sculptors . 
5. Thoughts on opening up space . While my first wood sculptures followed closely 
the original solid form of the ir logs, I increasingly worked on “opening up” 
the mass of wood to peer inside and to create internal spaces , interconnected T

         6 
openings and negative 3 -D forms . Here I collect views of several of my 
sculptures to illustrate  possibilities for “opening up ,” and to indicate the 
development of my approach to this.  
6. The practice of sculpting 3 -D form in wood . This section documents the succession 
of techniques and tools I have often used in my wood sculpture, illustrated 
with photos from the creation of several different works.   
7. A chronological catalog of all my sculptural works, numbering about two  hundred  
all together, of diverse sizes , themes, forms  and materials.

Keep up to date with my sculpture by downloading the latest version of the e -book 
(pdf) at: http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form/form.pdf . The pdf is formatted the 
same as the printed  version. The digital format allows me to continuously add my 
latest items to the catalog and other chapters. Viewing the pdf allows you to search 
the text and zoom in on details of the sculptures.  
Further information about this volume is available at: 
http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form . Versions for Kindle  (mobi) and iBooks (epub)  
can be downloaded there, although they are not as up -to-date and well formatted as 
the pdf .  
Go to: https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture  to open a webpage with videos of many  of 
my sculptures. They display the sculpture slowly turning 360º . The videos are brief – 
mostly about half  a minute.  The videos are organized into five groupings:  
• Videos of some of my wood carvings . A catalog of my wood carvings is 
available at:  https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture/carvings . 
• Videos of some of my abstract ceramic sculptures , modeled in clay and fired.  
• Videos of some of my modernist ceramic sculptures , inspired by Rodin, 
Degas, Brancusi, Giacometti, Heppenworth, Moore.  
• Videos of some of my pre -Columbian and prehistoric ceramic sculptures , 
based on artifacts. 
• Videos of some of my realistic sculptures of the human body , based on live 
or photographed models.  
The videos help to display the 3 -D form, the "opening up" of the material , and the 
play of positive and negative space as discussed in this book. The videos are silent. 
You can make the video full screen by clicking on the square icon in the lower right corner of the video image. To return from full screen, click on the same icon or press

1. Sculpture: 3- D Form from Wood  
I began exploring wood sculpture in the mid -1970s.  Wood sculptures continued to 
be my most important sculptural works throughout my life.  Here are two large pieces 
from 2020:  
 
Angel of Progress  and Return of the Osprey . 
Following are my wood sculptures in chronological order.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         18 
Gelassenheit (1976) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         19 
  
Gelassenheit  (Let it be ). Black walnut . Pine Run, New Jersey. 1976. Influenced by Heidegger’s 
ontology of unfolding beings, I  let the character of the log lead me to bring out the beauty of 
its colorful grain and co re. I tried to form interesting sweeping shapes that portray and 
enhance  the strength and solidity of the log ’s mass.

Twisted Sister (1977) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         21 
  
Twisted Sister . Cherry. Pine Run, New Jersey. 1977. Not influenced by E .T. (which it 
predated). This cherry tree trunk contained knots that became integrated into the sculpture. I 
opened up a space between two legs, which curved asymmetrically to define an interesting 
negative form. On one leg surface, I created a relief based on Indonesian sculptural 
traditions. 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         22 
Atomic Power (1983) 
 
Atomic Power . Cyprus. Philadelphia. 1983. This slab from a large tree was found in a dump of 
tree trunks, cut down by the City. I refined the outline of the slab and poked a hole 
surrounded by carving marks.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         23 
The Owl of Minerva (1995) 
 
The Owl of Minerva . Redwood. Niwot,  Colorado. 1995. Influenced by Hegel. I enjoyed carving 
4x4 redwood posts left from the deck of our Colorado house —easy to carve, retaining good 
edges, sanding smoothly, acquiring beautiful color when oiled and revealing strong, broad 
grain. Here, I not only opened a space between twisting legs, but also a large negative s pace 
at the head, drilling  all the way through to form an eye.  Gift to Alan.

Works of 3 -D Form  
         25 
  
Female Torso . Cottonwood. Niwot, Colorado. 1995.  Influenced by Bliss. A first attempt to 
represent a figure realistically. The sense of 3 -D proportion was achieved primarily by the 
sense of touch.

Paleolithic  and Prehistoric Figure Series  
 
Sculptors can learn a lot by creating studies of works of other sculptors, including 
from historical eras and other cultures. I found it particularly interesting to reproduce 
several of the earliest known sculptures. These are carvings in bone or stone, usually 
representing women, often pregnant. The carvings are impressive accomplishments, 
probably reflecting cross -generational communities of skilled carvers, perhaps 
women.  
Some of these prehistoric artifacts are small or fragmented, so I have tried to create a 
representation of them that is at a scale and level of detail that makes them easy to 
perceive and that brings out their underlying forms. The basic forms of the human  
body have clearly fascinated humans from their first attempts to represent figures in 
whatever materials were available – stone, bone, clay and eventually marble or bronze. 
It is a moving experience to reflect upon reproducing images created tens of 
thousands of years ago, when humans were  creating the first persistent self -
representations that we know of. In particular, the “Venus figures” that repeatedly appear across the populated world throughout millennia suggest the importance of 
widespread, multi -generational cultures involving langu age, tool skills, trade  and inter -
tribal communication.  
[See the section on “Pre -historic Sculptures” in Chapter 4, “ Reflections: Philosophy 
of 3-D Form,” below.]  
Here is a rough timetable of the figures I have tried to reproduce:

40,000-35,000 years before the present (BP), t he Venus of Hohle Fels  (also known as 
the Venus of Schelklingen  or the Tübingen Venus ) is an Upper Paleolithic  Venus figurine  
belonging to the early Aurignacian  culture , and is one of the oldest undisputed 
examples of Upper Paleolithic  art and figurative prehistoric art in general.  It is made 
of mammoth  ivory at the very beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, which is associated 
with the earliest presence of Cro -Magnon humans in Europe (where they mixed with 
Neanderthals – my own theory is that this mixing of species may have fostered the 
advent of art ). I came across the original figure in the archeological museum  in 
Tübingen  and was given a scale -model reproduction of it by a colleague who was 
friends with the archaeologist.

30,000– 27,000 BP, the Venus of Willendorf  was o riginal carved from an oolitic 
limestone that is not local to the area ; the stone may have come from across the Alps 
or 1,000 miles away. Parts of the body associated with fertility  and childbearing have 
been emphasized. Some hypothesize that such figurines may have been created as 
self-portraits by women, due to the correlation of the proportions of the statues to 
how women's bodies would seem when  looking down at themselves,  and to the lack 
of facial features .

         68 
    
29,000- 25,000 BP, the Venus of Dolni Vestonice -- ceramic  -- oldest known ceramic in 
the world, predating the use of fired clay to make pottery. The figurine was modeled 
from a mixture of clay and tempered bone and then fired . It is one of the first 
examples of ceramics.

27,000- 22,000 BP, the Venus of Laussel R elief. The original “Venus of Laussel” is a 
limestone bas -relief of a woman with the moon, marked off to count the lunar or 
menstrual cycle. Original carved on a cave wall and painted with red ochre.

25,000 BP, the Venus of Ostrava  (also known as  Venus of Petřkovice) – the original  
miniature headless female torso – only 5 cm in height – was carved from a piece of 
black hematite iron ore  during the  Gravettian industry culture. Uniquely, the absence 
of the head appears to be the author's intention. Also, unlike other prehistoric Venus 
figurines, it shows a slender young woman or girl with small breasts. It was discovered 
at an ancient settlement of m ammoth hunters.

         71 
    
21,000 BP, the Venus of New Avdeevo . This ivory figurine is generally well preserved. It 
is ten centimeters long with an erect head which has a sculptured face that looks 
forward and is covered by hair or a hat. shoulders are narrow, the chest is flattened, 
and the drop -shaped breasts lie slightly apart on top of t he slightly prominent 
abdomen. The forearms are beneath the breasts, under which the hands appear to be holding the upper part of the abdomen. The fingers are emphasized, and there is a 
bracelet on one wrist. A band decorated by a wedge -shaped notching is carved on the 
waist. The legs of this figurine are  slightly bent at the knees, below which they are 
separated by a bored hole.  A flattened area around the tailbone of this figurine 
emphasizes the absence of fatty deposits.

7,000- 4,500 BP, the Cylcadic standing figures  carved in marble on the Greek islands. 
These form a transition to the classic Greek sculpture at the start of the history of 
Western art.  
 
2,400 BP,  Nike of Samothrace – Winged Victory . The Nike (Victory) is represented with 
open wings, landing on the prow of a ship. The marble statue together with its base stood over 18 feet high above a sanctuary on the Northeast Aegean island of 
Samothrace , celebrating the victory of Rhodes at sea in 190 BCE. The goddess rests 
on her right leg as she lands. This leg is placed to the fore and draws her torso to the right, in contrast to her lower body which turns to the left. She wears garments that 
billow out behind her and double over in folds in front.  The active movement of this 
sculpture contrasts with the rigidity of Egyptian and Babylonian works, which preceded the classic Greek art.

Pre-Columbian Figure Series  
During my travels over my lifetime, I collected sculptures, especially pre -Columbian 
reproductions from Latin America. 
 
On the right are some I collected. On the left are some of what my family called 
“originalis,” small clay figures based on Aztec or Mayan sculptures. Also o n the left,  
an Olmec head that Carol won playing  tennis during our honeymoon in Veracruz and 
a Chacmool that my mother brought me from Mexico.  
Following are a series of ceramic sculptures that I did (lower shelf) based on these 
(upper shelf)  and other pre -Columbian figures in 2019.

         75 
 
The ancient ceramic pieces were made principally using coils and I noticed how small 
coils could be used for eyes and mouth. I also began to experiment with decorative 
finishes on my pieces, inspired by the Latin American cultures.  I sometimes 
referenced their love of gold, jade and turquoise.  As I read about pre -Columbian 
sculpture and ceramics, I was increasingly impressed by the subtle planes of facial 
images: the eye muscles and cheekbones were often modeled in graceful and 
expressive simplicity. Expres sion was conveyed more through decorative clothing and 
accessories than through facial countenance. I tried to adopt and adapt their sense of 
form and decoration.

Giacometti Studies Series  
After the pre -Columbian series, I did a series of studies based on Giacometti’s 
sculpture, especially his early cubist works. I read a lengthy biography of Giacometti, 
as well as books about other modern sculptors  such as Rodin and Degas. I began to 
experiment with making plaster casts of clay pieces as well as working directly in plaster , as Giacometti did .

Negative Structures Series  
As discussed in the chapter below on “Space: Opening Up 3 -D Form,”  much of my 
sculpture is concerned with penetrating the mass (wood, clay, plaster) of matter and 
creating an interior space or negative form within the positive material forms. A series 
of explorations of such negative structures in ceramics resulted in severa l pieces  in 
2008, such as the following: Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2,  Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture 
with Grog and  Negative  Structure . 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         85 
 
 
These ceramic works define spatial forms by creating structural boundaries or 
outlines. They open (create) space primarily by enclosing or surrounding it. Many of 
the spaces are cave -like, hinting at primordial cave rnous  living spaces. Here are some 
from 2022:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         86 
   
    
Complex spaces are interconnected within 3-D, in ways hard to visualize without the 
3-D structure to see, feel and explore. The pieces combine surface texture, volume, 
internal space and structure. Technically, they are constructed to balance the 
constraints of clay strength vs. gravity and span inte grity vs. the effects of shrinkage 
as the clay dries and is fired.

         87 
 
 
I continued to investigate structure sculptures in my 2021 clay maquettes and 2022 
wood carvings.  Some of these are made in several separate pieces, which are glued 
together in the end to create sparse structures defining open or negative spaces.

Figurative Modeling Series  
My older sculptures were rela tively abstract, non -figurative or  non-representational. 
Although people liked to see animals and other things represented in the sculptures, 
for me they were primarily explorations of abstract 3 -D form. However, once I began 
to work with clay and become more involved in learning about scu lpture, I began to 
take classes and workshops in figurative modeling, that is, capturing the human body 
in whole or in part as realistically as possible.  
I took courses on human portrait (the head), torso and full body. Some of these 
benefitted from live models. Most classes took place over multiple days at the Cotuit 
Center for the Arts, organized by Neil Grant.  
The portraitur e class helped me to see the st ructures of the human head : the bones 
of the skull, the muscles of the eyes and mouth, and the expressive flesh of people at different ages and engaged in talking or other behavior. After this class, I modeled a 
series of masks, presented in the next section.  
 
The workshops on torso and full body were usually two days long. They also stressed 
the structures and forms of the primary layers of skeleton, musculature, flesh and skin 
texture. The first day involved roughing a figure in using clay on a simple wooden 
armature  post. The second day refined the figure and its surface. Then the piece was 
hollowed out so it could dry without breaking from clay shrinkage and so it could 
safely be fired. In two days, I could not create a detailed and polished sculpture, 
captur ing the many aspects of realistic representation. Instead, I aimed at quick

         91 
studies, which  caught the primary forms and retained a rough surface reflecting the 
working of the clay.  
 
The figurative works of reclining models and torsos complemented my other 
explorations of seated figures, such as  Reclining Figure: Holes  Model,  Chacmool , Pregnant 
Mayan  and Nyarit Seated Man .

Eight Ceramic Mask Selfies 
 
These eight self -portrait masks were made in Fall 2019. First, Bob Marcus helped me 
make a life- casting mask of my face from a kit. From the temporary mask, I made a 
plaster mold. Then I pressed slab s of clay into the mold and used the resulting curved 
form s as base s for modeling the clay selfies.  
It is hard to capture a personality in a mask because a person’s unique bone structure 
and muscle configuration changes continuously as they speak and move. The 
expressive muscles around the mouth change the most, but the eye muscles, smile 
wrinkles and ch eek bones also shift significantly.  
So, I tried to make a series of masks with different expressions and sculptural 
techniques. I took pictures of my face in the mirror as my model.  
I experimented with diverse ways  of representing 3 -D facial features. For instance, 
Rodin created undulating waves that seem to press outward from the interior of the 
work. Giacometti amassed small, indistinct bits to define human forms without 
recreating smooth surfaces in order to just provide an impression of the form as seen 
ambiguously from a distance. When I fired the pieces, I sometimes used colored slips to add color to the white, brown or reddish clay.

Sea Forms Se ries 
Since I live by the ocean now, I am interested in exploring natural shapes in forms 
from the sea.  
Seashells fascinate me. They come in complex and beautiful forms, which are grown 
by strange organisms (clams, oysters, etc.) and are often adopted by other organisms 
(such as small crabs) when their original creators outgrow them.  
 
I carved some long, twisting forms based on seashells I found on the beach. 
 
This is a sculpture I did in clay, modeled on a smaller bone from the beach, probably a seal’s 
spinal disk  
Ocean waves are the results of complex interactions of water rushing in different 
directions as well as the slope of the shore  floor. Waves roll in to the beach relentlessly 
and rhythmically. They are calming to hear and watch, in their repetition, endless variety and perpetual motion. Standing on the shoreline, one can observe the water 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         119 
from the last wave rolling back into the sea, where it is met by and overpowered by 
the next wave rushing in. The under and over flowing of the opposed movements 
create the breaking wave front. The interaction is so fluid and quick that it is hard to 
follow. Sculpture of a wave front can strive to capture and freeze this ceaseless 
motion.

Casting in Plaster  
Inspired by Giacometti’s plaster sculptures and casts, I decided to try sculpting in 
plaster and ma king plaster casts of clay sculptures. Of course , sculptors primarily  cast 
their sculptures to preserve them and to make multiple copies for sale. Casting in 
bronze goes back to prehistory. Plaster casting is a less expensive and complicated 
alternative. Today, there are many plastic and resin options  as well . 
Even before reading about Giacometti, I had started to use plaster and to make some 
simple casts with hints from local sculptors (Neil  Grant , Hiram  Ball and Bob  Marcus). 
As an aid to my series of masks, I made one -piece casts of a model skull in clay, and 
I made one- piece clay molds of my Nickerson coins . I also made simple casts of  my 
masks of Ruby and Ora for distribution to relatives.  
When I did the studies of Giacometti, I had to create completely  three -dimensional 
molds , rather  than the one-sided forms for the masks. I started to use EZ -Mix 40 
urethane rubber for the molds and eventually Free -Form Air for two -piece mother 
molds to hold the molds during casting. I switched from plaster of Paris to Hydrocal, a stronger form of plaster. The EZ -Mix 40 liquid rubber was painted onto a clay 
sculpture, which had been waxed as a release. When the rubber hardened, the mold 
had to be slit to tak e out the sculpture. The mother mold was designed to hold the 
slit closed, but that was tricky in practice. I took a four -day course on mold making 
and then made three more -successful molds at home.  
 
These are the three plaster casts that emerged .

         135 
 
Here is my portrait of Giacometti. Behind it is the blue rubber cast with the jagged 
slit for removing the cast and the gray mother -mold that holds the flexible mold in 
place during the pouring of the liquid plaster.  
Many of Giacometti’s clay sculptures decayed and crumbled in his studio. His brother, 
Diego, made molds and plaster casts, which saved many sculptures. I can see how this was important , as several of my studies of Giacometti also broke , and the plaster casts 
were a way to preserve them.  Giacometti cast his clay sculptures in plaster and 
eventually in bronze for sale. He did not fire the clay because he usually worked on 
metal armatures to support the clay.  
I customarily  fire and sometimes glaze  my clay originals. I often paint the plaster casts 
to look gold  or bronze. Here are my casts of the Pregnant Mayan, Tony’s Torso  and my 
portrait of the artist. Other casts are shown in the section on Giacometti Studies and 
in the Catalog.

Above are two plaster c asts of my study of Giacometti ’s “Tall Figure, ” One is painted 
bronze. 
In addition to creating a bronze appearance with metallic paints, I tried “cold casting” 
my Portrait of Giacometti . This involves mixing powdered bronze metal into the top 
coat of the black epoxy used for casting.  
 
Other casts of my studies of Giacometti’s early cubist works follow:  his “Head ,” 
“Couple ,” “Torso” and “Head .”

Cold Casting in Bronze  
After a busy season with clay and plaster casts, I finished 2019 by returning to wood 
carving, completing A Bite of the Apple , Sea Goddess of the Cape , Hinged Forms  and Return 
of the Osprey . I then took a break from sculpture, including two months in Florida. I 
returned home in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic.  
Without access to a kiln, I decided to focus on cold casting bronze, as I had attempted 
with the bust of Giacometti. I had in mind reproducing two sets of my clay figures:  
• A historic series in honor of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims landing on 
Cape Cod, with the Nickerson coin, the mask of William Nickerson and the 
mask of Josiah Mayo.   
• A series of prehistoric women: Venus  from Tubingen , Venus of Willendorf , Venus 
Relief, Larger Cycladic Figure and Athena.  
I acquired some new casting materials from the closeout of Hiram’s studio. I made 
the molds using Rebound 25, a flexible rubber material. I made mother molds from 
Free form Air, to hold the molds during casting. I cast using SmoothCast Onyx Slow, 
a black plastic, mixing in 1/3-part bronze filings. To bring out the bronze sheen, I 
rubbed the castings with steel wool and sprayed on a transparent finish  or waxed 
them . I also used Smooth- On 325, a casting material I had used for the Portrait of 
Giacometti  and the first set of bronze coins and bronze masks.  
The coin molds and mask molds were simple one -piece open molds. I poured the 
liquid casting mixture into the mold and swished it around to cover the surface to an 
adequate depth. I mounted two sets of the coin inverse and reverse for display, as well 
as the masks of Nickerson and Mayo.  These were for display at the Mayo House and 
the Nickerson Homestead exhibitions. I also cast bronze copies for myself.

The historic series was more problematic. It turned out that the clay I had used for 
Venus of Willendorf and the Venus relief was incompatible  with the mold material, so 
they bound together and I had to discard the original sculpture along with its mold.  
The Venus  from Tubingen  casting did not work well; it came our covered with sticky 
black liquid from the casting mixture . I made round bases for the original and for the 
casting of the Venus  from Tubingen  using  Smoothcast Onyx Slow  casting mixture 
without bronze , to support them on their small legs .

to using Smooth- On 325 for these, mixing in the bronze powder. I was able to make

Photography of Ceramics and Sculpture  
Sculpture is famously difficult to photograph. Of course, one problem is that you 
cannot capture much of a 3 -D form in a 2 -D medium. But in addition, the subtleties 
of the surface are tricky to reproduce. Lighting, shadow, highlights, etc. are important 
in bringing out the three- dimensionality, depth and surface texture  
With advice from photographer Brown  Bergen , I bought a camera with good control 
of depth of field (F -stop) and experimented by taking many of the photos in this 
book, especially for the pieces created in 20 19. I also bought a set of photography 
lights and backdrops. I set up a photography area in a dark part of the basement so I 
could control the lighting.  
One thing I tried to do was capture the depth of my attempts to “open up” the mass 
of my wood and ceramic sculptures.

4. Reflections:  Philosophy of 3-D 
Form  
“One must give value to one’s existence by behaving as if one's very existence were a work of art.”   
        – Fr. Nietzsche  
Thoughts on Organic F orm from N ature 
Prior to retirement, I occasionally carved wooden logs. I followed the lead of the log 
and of my tools, producing flowing curves that brought out the beauty and sensuality 
of the wood , as it had grown within a tree . I felt a kinship to the sculptures of Henry 
Moore and learned  about the abstraction of 3 -D form  from his masterpieces. As I 
became more involved in sculpture —including ceramics and plaster casts —I 
wondered increasingly about the role and nature of sculpture in today’s world, given 
the developmen ts in the field during my lifetime. This chapter presents  some of my 
reflections on that question.  
Historically, organic sculptural form was often associated with representation of the bodies of humans and animals. The invention of mechanical reproducibility with 
photography and video not only changed the aura of th ose work s (according to 
Benjamin), but also questioned the role of realistic likeness in sculpture. Modern 
European sculpture transitioned from realistic representation to more abstract study 
of 3-D forms in the oeuvres of Rodin, Brancusi, Degas, Giacometti, Moore, etc. That 
transition period in the history of sculpture by the generation or two before me has 
appealed to me more than subsequent developments, like metal constructions of 
geometric or industrial forms, experiments with high -tech materials , environmental 
happenings or pop- art plays on everyday artifacts.  
As this book documents, I have explored a delimited range of possibilities of 20
th and 
21st century sculpture. This included studies and reproductions of ancient sculptures, 
including the earliest known human  examples: Paleolithic, Cycladic, pre -Columbian 
and modern masterpieces. I took courses on realistic sculpture of the human body 
and used live models for portraits and torsos, to develop and understand the 
techniques involved  and to study the forms . The idea of “opening up” a log or lump 
of clay to crea te negative as well as positive forms and spaces is one specific direction 
that I have pursued.

         189 
The Working of a Work of Art 
Art— in contrast to objects of daily utility —functions to make our world visible, 
tangible and sensuous. It opens up the working  of the works of art. One wants to 
explore, touch, move around and contemplate pieces of sculpture in ways one rarely 
interacts with other objects . Everyday things are simply present for use in actions that 
are focused on implicit  goals;  we tacitly exploit  these objects as mere subservient 
means , paying little heed to their inherent qualities  and visual  appearance . 
Space is the Place 
Works of art draw attention to themselves, rather than to some other realm. They 
stand out in the everyday world by creating their own space. Space is an unobserved  
structure that is normally taken for granted or abstracted as a simple mathematical 
configuration  or empty volume . We move through space and glance through space 
without explicitly perceiving  the space itself. Every physical object takes up a space, 
which it defines by the volume within and around its surface. By displaying itself as a 
visual object, a sculpture can make visible the space it fills and the space it opens up 
around itself. It is even possible for a sculpture to be designed to open up spaces 
within the positive forms of the sculpture’s material, creating negative spaces , which can 
themselves become centers of focus .  
Making Reality Visible 
Objects from different realms have different forms. Sculptures can make these 
obtrusive and perceptible. Architecture  (which was originally inseparable from 
sculpture)  can both construct and reveal the spaces within which humans reside. Pop 
art makes the character of everyday, taken -for-granted commodities noticeable. 
Forms of the sea and sea life differ from those of the land ; sculpture can contrast 
these forms . Scale —which sculpture can play with —also makes a difference, bringing 
out details, relationships and spaces that are hidden on accustomed scale s. 
Mass Production 
Manufactured  objects today are commercial  commodities, explicitly designed for easy 
mass production by automated machinery , and mass produced with standardization 
for universal assembly. They have flat, 2 -D surfaces , following simpl istic 
mathematical shapes. They are efficient to fabricate  by machine and are 
interchangeable to facilitate  economical exchange on the global commodity market. 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         190 
They are derived forms of abstract value, not specific to any characteristics of origin, 
setting or intended application.  
Natural Evolution 
Organic forms, by contrast , evolve in response to their immediate environment. Their 
form follows from their uniquely situated function: a tree’s limbs bend to allow their 
leaves to capture sunlight in their particular setting , and a bird’s bones are shaped to 
provide strength and mobility with minimal weight and mass. Such conditions of growth result in flowing, but unique and complex  formations, with parts that support 
distinct functions  connected by transitional forms, which flow into each other, rather 
than simply butting up against each other and requiring connectors. An organism 
consists of an integrated formation  of multiple parts , with specialized forms merging  
into each other.  Organic sculpture can aim  to capture such structure in ways that 
display it to an observer’s senses.  
The Manufactured Environment  
In a philosophic passage, I once wrote that my sculptures are responses to the artificial character of the contemporary synthetic  environment. T oday’s  urban setting consists 
of plastic and concrete structures manufactured with homogenous materials and 
uniform geometric shapes, rather than with the organic forms of natur e. Technologies 
of manufacture have imposed these rigid, flat, symmetric shapes that are totally controlled by their makers  and machines. These shapes are simple and instantly 
understood by o bservers, so they fade into the background of assumed second nature , 
rather than provoking attention .  
In the twentieth century, several sculptors explored biomorphic abstraction , which 
features the subtle, flowing forms of biological nature in contrast to manufactured 
designs. These sculptures have always appealed to me and inspired my own efforts. 
Perhaps the biomorphic approach complemented the mathematical paradigm, which 
dominated my professional life in computer science.  
Organic Form 
My sculptures are not ahistorical ; not the result of some primordial experience of self -
consciousness interacting with unmediated nature. They are late -twentieth -century  
and early -twenty -first-century  explorations of form and material. In them, organic 
three -dimensional forms are showcased to contrast with socially prevalent two -
dimensional representations and with the basic geometric shapes produced by 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         191 
automated machinery. The inherent characteristics of the materials of nature are 
brought forth, in contrast to the artificial plastic substances that retreat from our 
consciousness in commodities. Furthermore , the usual pragmatic representational 
function of semiotic  objects is overcome  in the study of their abstracted physical 
forms and materiality. In negating  and surpassing  (Hegel: “ Aufhebung ”) the 
commonplace characteristics of signs —which point away from themselves —the non-
representational sculptures o btrusively confront their creator and viewers with the 
nature of the artifact itself as intentionally formed material object. Not representing 
some external subject, they point to themselves.  
Biomorphic Form and Cubism 
Biological organisms have evolved over eons to integrate multiple organs. Each organ 
has its distinctive function. The structure of the organism unites its constituent organs  
together in to a smooth functioning , creating a higher -level formation. Analogously, a 
complex sculpture can integrate multiple 3 -D forms, which complement or contrast 
with each other. Different faces of a particular mass can assume forms at tension with 
each other. A successful sculpture unifies its many sub-forms into a coherent 
structure.  My wood sculptures tend to be biomorph ic, often adopting 3 -D forms 
similar to biological organisms.  
Cubism tried to capture multiple visual perspectives on an object simultaneously. As 
works of 3 -D form, sculptures embody multiple perspectives when viewed from 
shifting angles. Cubism freed the arrangement of parts of a given object —such as 
organs within an organism or body —and sculpture can ad opt that freedom by 
displaying parts of a body selectively according to a unity of the sculpture that differs 
from that of its model —such as repositioning the features of a human face or body 
to highlight them indivi dually . The structure of the sculpture re presents selective 
aspects and arrangements of its model, while presenting  its own structural form , its 
re-integration of formal elements.  
A sculpture may integrate subparts at multiple levels. A complex form like Return of 
the Osprey may have numerous parts, each of which forms an organism of 3 -D forms 
flowing into each other. It may take a viewer some time and effort to explore the 
sculpture at different scales and viewing angles.  
Rodin’s dynamic human poses  and Degas’ dancers make visual and haptic the 
structural potentials of the human body, with its joints and musculature. They often 
exceed or exaggerate the possible poses, combining specific perspectives and 
consecutive views slightly out of time. There is a tension between the model and the 
sculpture, in which post -photographic realism extends what is possible in the literally 
represented original.

         192 
Rodin Working on Works 
In his evocative book on Rodin, Rilke emphasized the creation of “ works” as a driving 
force for Rodin. The ephemeral w ork on sculptures was often more important than 
the persistent sculptures that resulted. The resultant sculptures were always somehow 
considered inadequate  by Rodin ; the problems that had been pursued in them were 
not completely or satisfactorily solved; it was hard to say when a given piece was 
finished —except by noting if it had been signed in preparation  for sale. Rodin lived 
above all to engage in his sculptural  work ing. 
Degas never exhibited or sold his sculptures, except for “The Little Dancer.” He did 
not cast them, but simply worked on them in his studio for their own sake , as 
explorations of the possibilities of sculpture and the potentials of human bodily movement through space. Similarly , Giacometti  was driven to work and re -work his 
pieces endlessly , searching to capture his vision, rather than to produce finished 
pieces. The important thing is the working that goes into the work, rather than the 
resultant object, w hich captures  and preserve s the working.  Rodin, Giacometti and 
Degas all liked to come back to old pieces and re -work them —undercutting the sense 
that works were ever final, that th ey were no longer subject to working.  
In my recent involvement in sculpture, m y days often revolve around an agenda of 
working on some current piece. The point is not so much to produce yet more  object s, 
since I am not selling or using the resultant products. The point is to engage in the 
work, explore a sculptural or technical problem, re -discover what some other sculptor 
found in creating something that inspired me. The working is more important than the work , which drives and results from the working . Often, I attempt to capture 
something ab out the working in the resultant work.  
Degas’s Dancers 
Sculpture  can display the structure of objects, rather than just their surface 
appearances and attributes. Degas’ dancers, balanced instantaneously on one leg, 
capture the ephemeral structure of a ballerina’s motion through space around a center 
of gravity. The placement of the ballerina’s feet and the twist of her torso reflect 
slightly different moments in time and thereby imply and capture motion, like the 
subtly superimposed feet of Degas’ galloping horses , caught impossibly in mid -air. 
Although Degas’ sculptures , like “Grand Arabesque ,” represent  the human  form 
realistically, they a re freed from traditional conventions to centrally incorporate space, 
void and motion by allusion. His fleshed- out female forms begin to act as structural 
indications of space, with limbs reaching out in every direction. Dance suggests the 
flux of time, in which Degas’ figures unfold from one study to the next in growing 
configurations of space and figure integrated. Degas thereby defi ned the transition

from representation to structu re in the history of sculpture according to Charles 
Millard, Curator of the Hirshhorn  Museum , in his study of Degas . 
Giacometti’s Plaster Sculptures 
Giacometti’s emaciated plaster busts and human figures capture the core spatial 
existence of a man or woman. The irreducible residue of one of his female sculpture s 
reduces her entire reality to being seen, according to John Berger, who feels that 
Giacometti created his plaster figures during his lifetime , for himself, as observer or 
anticipator of his future absence, his death, his becoming unknowable after occupying 
an un -shareable reality. We now take the place of Giacometti in looking at the tall 
woman , in her structure as a solitary presence.  
Despite all the talk of Giacometti’s figures as representing existential alienation, his 
figures inevitably take up social and spatial positions in the shared world —with the 
many other plaster figures in his studio, with selected companions in exhibition 
collections and within spaces explicitly defined by their platforms, glass enclosures 
and metal cage outlines. Individual human forms are elements in composite material 
and social structures.   
The structure s of Giacometti’s constructions prominently include  spatial 
relationships, with the distances between plaster figures indicating social distances and 
their glances passing by and ignoring each other to accentuate the reduction to solitary 
individuals in communal settings. The spaces defined between figures , cages or 
platform edges create distance from the viewer, much as a painting’s chosen 
perspective does. Giacometti’s sculpture creates vacuum  (nothingness) , starting from 
mass or plenum  (being) , according to Sartre— locating his friend’s work within the 
dialectical conceptualizations of Being and Nothingness . The radically reduced positive 
space of the sculpture  projects negative space all about it, stretching out to the viewer 
and distancing the figure as alone and un -reachable. 
I have been intrigued by the creation of space through configurations of matter and void. Lived, meaningful space is not a mathematical manifold or Newtonian 
coordinate system, extending uniformly everywhere, absolute and independent of 
content arbitrarily located within it. Rather, it is a felt openness to being, projected 
around specific materials in concrete formations. Space invites and envelopes  objects, 
flows around them, opens  opportunities for other shapes; it  penetrates into gaps 
through and betwee n the objects. The sculptural form opens up the space in which 
matter  appears and also in which it pointedly does not appear.  
In my attempts to open up masses, such as in my recent ceramic constructions  (see 
below  my “Thoughts on opening up spaces”),  I create  structures that define intricate 
positive and negative spaces without covering up the surface o r filling in the interior.  
One way to open up a space most effectively is to reduce the mass of the positive 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         194 
focal form to a minimum, as Giacometti did in his mature sculptures. For Giacometti, 
this approach corresponded to the character of human vision.  He said he struggled 
to capture what his eye actually perceive d, as opposed to what the mind constructs as 
a figure. Of course, his eye was uniquely trained by a lifetime of looking carefully at 
models. Moreover, what he referred to as the mind  that imposes meanings was its 
preconceptions and stereotypical images.  
Realistic Sculpture 
For a while, I work ed on realistic sculptures of live models and from photos of people, 
especially human faces, including my own. Working from a live model is invaluable 
training for seeing the structures of heads and bodies. Standard techniques  for 
creating masses and planes  are also helpful in roughing in the 3- D forms. However, 
the rote representation of a subject using established techniques for reproducing some 
supposedly objective view of the subject is not in itself  an artistic process. For 
instance, using pointing machines in the baroque era to produce copies of living 
bodies was useful for some processes, like making copies of a sculpture, but less for 
creating an original work of art.  
When we see somebody —not by staring at their facial image as at a photo— as part 
of interacting with them, we do not perceive a smooth manifold with standard features and manifold details. We see the person, the personality, perhaps as 
synthesized into  a vague mental  image of their general likeness  or attitude .  
Consequently,  a sculptural representation of the person should not be a 3 -D 
reproduction of their body, frozen at one instant. It should be something that projects 
their personality. That is the source of Rodin’s emotional movement, often distorting 
the surface in energized waves of vibration. Similarly, it is the person’s spatia l 
presence, at its essential core in Giacometti’s structures, which resist being confined to precise and smooth appearances. These sculptures may not look “realistic” in the 
photogr aphic sense, but the artists felt that they captured living reality in a sculptural 
way. 
The critic, Leo Steinberg, argued that realistic sculpture is important even after the invention of the camera, but not in a rote, technological sense. He claimed that “the 
eye is part of the mind,” that is , that  
“technical capacity in imitation implies what no one seriously believes: that nature confronts man with a fixed, invariant look. We know better than that. 
Appearances reach us through the eye, and the eye is part of the brain and 
therefore inextricably inv olved in mysterious cerebral operations. Thus, nature 
presents every generation (and every person who will use his eyes for more than 
nodding recognitions) with a unique and unrepeated facet of appearance…. And 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         195 
if appearances are thus unstable in the human eye, their representation in art is 
not a matter of mechanical reproduction, but of progressive revelation.”  
Works connected with discoveries of representation, purvey not given facts, but “the 
thrill and wonder of cognition. ” 
According to Steinberg, about half the great art generated by humanity —starting with 
Paleolithic art —is dedicated to the accurate transcription of the sensible world. 
However, artists do so in particular ways, rendering their subjects according to 
available technologies, cultures, conceptualizations, predecessors and the gleanings of their own work. Standardized techniques for capturing likeness miss the to -be-
interpreted character of the subject.  
A modern photo can instantaneously reproduce the physical appearance of a subject 
at a specific moment. However, for instance in the case of a face speaking or a body 
moving, the muscles involved (with their accompanying prominences and shadows) 
are contin uously shifting. The perceived appearance over a time segment posits the 
unity to these momentary stages. It is the interpreted unity that projects an underlying character or personality or motion or emotion to the subject. The challenge is to then 
represe nt in a 3 -D form the subject’s character through this unity —rather than simply 
a photo -like snapshot picture. If “realistic” means aiming for the snapshot, then 
sculpture needs to incorporate the techniques of realism without setting them as the 
ultimate  aim. The representational goal is, rather, to capture the personality that shines 
through the unity of the likeness.  
Tutorials on realistic sculpture rightly emphasize procedures of building up from 
skeleton to musculature to flesh (fat and skin). These are the layers that  conduct the 
body’s motion: the joints, the tendons and the masses. They are not static structures, but vibrant effectors of motion. As they shift and swirl, the body’s forms swell and 
ebb. Each individual’s figure is defined by its unique configuration of  bones, muscles, 
fat deposits and skin wrinkles. As a person breathes, speaks and moves, this unique 
complex cycles through its characteristic topologies. The sculptor struggles to capture 
this through his eye, mind, body, materials, skills, techniques and  style. 
Eye and Mind 
For the philosopher Merleau -Ponty, human existence is fundamentally embodied. 
Visual perception is the primary mode of perception of the human body. Vision is 
intimately integrated with our tactile sense, so that “the visible world and the world 
of my motor projects are eac h total parts of the same Being ” (Eye and Mind ). 
Sculpture corresponds to this foundational unity of vision and touch. A sculpture 
leads the hand and eye across its surfaces, whether actually or in the perceiver’s 
imaginative projection . Unlike painting or even relief, the 3 -D forms lure perception 
around the facing façade and into the sculpture’s depth. Although only certain shifting 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         196 
surfaces are v isible at any given moment, the  different perspectives  possible from 
around the mass  flow into each other, evoking and leading eye and hand and mind.  
Sculpture explores the depth of objects in the world. While depth is merely implied 
in painting, through tricks of perspective and shading, for instance, it is  explicit in the 
massing of 3 -D forms.  The sub- forms of a sculpture reference each other by 
overlapping and concealing —only to then reveal as one circumnavigates the 
sculpture. As Merleau -Ponty puts it, “The enigma consists in the fact that I see things , 
each one in its place, precisely because they eclipse one another , and that they are 
rivals before  my sight precisely because each one is in its own place.”  As one 
successively perceives each facet, the previously seen  planes recede into hidden but 
remembered depths. Each angle on the sculpture reveals new, unanticipated forms 
and integrates them into a felt 3 -D whole, with depth in space.  
The sculpture’s flow of curves and obtrusive features forms a surface, creating a 
boundary between the surrounding transparent space and the opaque internal mass. 
Depending upon the material of the sculpture, one may wonder about the nature of 
the interior. For instance, the hidden grain within  a wood sculpture , its transition from 
outer to core wood,  residues of its  sticky amber sap, origins  of its former branches 
and other organic vestiges of its growth  may suggest mysterious  structures of potential 
interest. The hardness of stone may challenge one to desire a glimpse inside  and the 
homogeneity of clay might motivate an urge to break its impenetrability.  
The dynamic of the observer’s perception of a work has its correspondence in the 
prior production of the work by the sculptor. The sculptor undergoes similar 
perceptual processes, possibly more focused, even conscious  or reflective. The forms 
emerge in the work  as the sculptor may attempt to bring out,  structure and mold  the 
perceptual effects . The material offers unexpected features and the sculptor’s work 
responds by enhancing or removing selected features to create interesting forms and 
an over- all work,  with its effects of perceptual stimulation, motion, depth and space . 
The successive stages of sculpting define forms at different scales, which may be 
compatible with each other. The selection of a particular log or a bag of clay; the 
roughing in of the log o r the massing of clay; the construction of major forms or 
primary  structural elements; the defining of flowing or rough surfaces; the refining of 
forms and surfaces; the finishing of surfaces with oil, glaze, paint, embedded elements; the mounting of the finished piece; lighting; photography; display ; presentation . 
A sculptor who explores and learns about specific material forms  may try to render 
those discoveries visible and even dramatic in the work  as a being  in the world .

A Heideggerian View of Sculpture  
In his essay on “The Thing,” the philosopher of Being, Heidegger , considers  the 
example of a jug, as created by a potter on a wheel. He suggests  that the thingness of 
the jug is centered on its  interior void, which can be filled with water or wine and can 
offer it for pouring and imbibing. But he does not describe how the jug comes to be 
what it is  as a unique being.  
Learning to make pottery  involves acquiring skills and knowledge to be able to 
produce jugs and other ceramic works that more or less fulfill th e ability of a 
successful jug. This has many aspects; creating a jug (e.g., on a potter’s wheel) involves 
a series of phases: acquiring and preparing the clay, gathering the tools and equipment, 
centering the lump of clay on the rotating wheel, opening a void in the lump, pulling 
the sides up in several pulls without the sides collapsing, shaping the form  (with the 
interior curve corresponding to  the exterior curve), partially drying the piece to give 
it strength, trimming the thrown piece and cutting a foot on it, gently shaping  a spout 
that will pour without dripping, attaching a pulled length of clay for a handle that will 
fit a human grip and p rovide balanced lifting, slowly  drying the clay without cracking, 
optionally adding design to the surface, firing the jug, glazing it and firing it again.  
Each stage of producing the jug is an experiment and the final product is always 
somewhat of a surprise. One learns through years of practice how to control each 
phase and what one prefers as results of each stage. However, at most phases there is 
usually some interplay between one ’s aims and the results. Generally, when one sees 
the piece as it is uncovered during the drying or when it comes out of the kiln, one is confronted by an object with its own character, and one must take up what one finds 
as the starting point for the next phase . As Hegel said, the worker is alienated from 
his product as it becomes an independent object existing in the world. There are so 
many variables in the clay, the wheel speed, the drying conditions, the pressure of the 
hands, the chemical reactions of the glaze and the work of the potter that one can 
only approach an ideal of control where one can produce something like w hat one set 
out to make. Such control takes considerable experimentation and practice.  
Ceramic jugs are one of the oldest and most universal of human artifacts. Once humans around the world harnessed fire, they learned to make and “fire” (bake) useful 
and beautiful jugs. My study of pottery is part of my philosophic investigation of the 
nature of artifacts. 
In The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger writes:  
“Although it becomes actual only as the creative act is performed, and thus 
depends for its reality upon this act, the nature of creation is determined by the 
nature of the work…. To create is to cause something to emerge as a thing that 
has been brought forth. The work’s becoming a work is a way in which truth 
becomes and  happens. ”

         198 
The craft of the artist involves  creating  a work  that opens up a world and reveals 
something  (as discussed in  my philosophy dissertation) . This craft requires a 
dialectical back and forth between the artist’s inquiring over time and the successive 
revelations  of the art works  produced.  The artist— akin to  a philosopher or scientist —
proceeds along  a journey of inquiry, gradually revealing new truth s through sequences 
of more -or-less insightful works. This is a historical process, in which the artist pushes 
his or her own previous inquiries further in specific directions, confronting issues that 
arose in past works and employing techniques that have been developed in previous 
inquiries , including by earlier artists . This involves mastering crafts, materials and 
technologies  of the past or of earlier  works . It involves posing specific problems to 
solve , and new directions to explore. 
In his discussion of a van Gogh painting, Heidegger generally misses its art -historical 
importance. He views the painting as purely representational of a peasant woman’s 
shoes. He misses the relationship to the impressionist revelations about light (and 
shadow) or van Gogh’s own exploration of brushstroke as an elem ent of the 
materiality of paint.  
The work involves a dynamic between revealing and concealing. As a work, a 
sculpture opens a special space around itself, structured by its 3 -D form, which 
reaches  out in that space. The surfaces of the form are revealed, but they 
simultaneously conceal what lies below , behind  or beyond the surface: the interior of 
the wood, stone or other material  and its hidden facets . This dynamic that takes place 
at the surface of a sculpture is Heidegger’s notion of the “ Riss,” which I always found 
to be the most obscu re concept in his essay on art. I did not fully realize how Riss 
entails  both the tearing conflict between un -concealing and re -concealing and also the 
design, outline or figure of the work, e.g., the surface form of a sculpture , which 
defines its shape while enclosing its interior  and indicating its hidden perspectives . 
Certain sculptures may attempt to open up th e concealed  interior— for instance by 
poking a hole into or through the surface forms , or by chipping away the smooth 
outer surface to expose internal material —and perhaps simultaneously to reveal the 
effort of carving the material by leaving traces of that human effort and procedure.  
Through such elements of the work’s design, the interior is opened up, but then 
simultaneously closed up along the new surfaces of the holes. 
Negative form can be viewed as an effort to reverse what is concealed and what is 
revealed. In some sculptures, I have tried to reveal the space itself by simply outlining 
it or otherwise indicating it. In others, I have tried to open up the normally conce aled 
interior space by providing just a structure to define it as a space, while leaving the 
interior— or at least the interior space —visible.  One could consider Giacometti’s thin 
plaster sculptures to be presenting just the interior of a figure, absent the  usual 
concealing layer of fat and skin.  (See my Study of Giacometti Tall Figure in contrast to 
my Chatham Sunbather  or Tony’s Torso.)

         199 
In my Globe Structure Maquette , the work is almost reduced to its supporting structure.  
This opens up the surface of the globe that would have covered it, revealing not just 
the interior space, but also the structures of hidden sides. Although each individual 
perspective provides a different, unanticipated image of the work, it also reveals 
enough of the other sides  to show how they relate. In addition, in this work the 
negative spaces become as important as the positive forms, often seeming to support 
or at least define them.   
 
    
    
 
The inquiries into opening up that began with pocking a hole in a solid mass have 
here reached a point where the negative spaces open connections among the various 
surfaces. Both negative and positive spaces flow into each other in complex ways, which guide the observer’s hand, eye and mind around the structure.

         200 
The work of art is also a communication between the creator and the observer of the 
work, an attempt to guide the viewer/preserver to see what the creator has made 
visible in the work. As Heidegger notes  about viewing art, “Preserving the work does 
not reduce people to their private experiences, but … grounds being for and with one 
another as the historical standing -out of human existence in reference to un -
concealed -ness.” Thus, the work functions to build historically situated inter -
subjectivity , grounded in the work . 
 A work of sculpture brings some thing into the world, opening up a space for it to 
do its work  in its historical social setting.  It is interesting to consider how sculpture 
has worked in different periods of human creativity.

Pre-histor ic Sculpture 
Like every cultural tradition, sculpture is an on -going conversation across generations 
of practitioners. Art is considered a characteristically human mode of expression. 
Sculpture as 3 -D form takes its place along with 2- D drawing or painting, music, 
dance, and other art forms. Particularly since communication was established globally, artists in one part of the world have been influenced by exemplars  of art from other 
places and times. For instance, it is now possible to see paradigmatic samples of art 
from the primary stylistic epochs and principal world regions collected next to each 
other at major museums.  
I have been interested in prehistoric  and non -European sculpture, particularly during 
my travels to the countries where these were created. Sculptures from non -
technological cultures  are often quite abstract, in the sense that they abstract away 
from details and capture larger forms in a stylized way. This abstraction may be 
attributed to the limitations of the sculptural materials (bone, stone, clay) and tools 
(hand, sharpened rock) or to cultural traditions or to some innate human mode of 
observation, tho ught and expression. One can learn much from these works. I was 
astonished at the extent to which the oldest known sculpture of the human figure 
teaches you when you try to duplicate it  and was delighted by how the earliest Latin 
American  carvings do so as well.  
In my own sculptural attempts, I have often tried to follow the lead of historic (or 
pre-historic) examples. By mimicking their forms in my own way and in my own 
materials, I have been inspired and gained insight into 3 -D form s. 
The T übingen V enus 
The Venus of Hohle Fels is an Upper Paleolithic figurine dated to between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest undisputed examples of figurative 
prehistoric art.  This figurine of a voluptuous woman carved from mammoth ivory 
and excavated from a cave in southwestern Germany is the oldest known example of 
3-D or figurative representation of humans , and sheds new light on the origins of art.  
Works of 3 -D Form

Four views of the Venus of Hohle Fels. The figure is about 2 ½ inches tall  (slightly larger 
than the picture here ). 
The intricately carve d headless figure is at least 5, 000 years older than previous 
figurines and dates from shortly after the arrival of genetically modern humans in 
Europe. It exhibits many of the characteristics of fertility, or Venus, figurines ca rved 
millennia  later.  
It was found in southern Germany in the Danube valley, the migration corridor for 
modern Homo Sapiens into Europe. The figurine’s  site was successively and 
repeatedly home to both Neanderthals  and Homo S apiens . This raises the possibility 
that such figurative art arose through the confrontation or intermixing of these two 
humanoid species. There is no evidence of art in the culture of the Neanderthals, but 
also no art like this in the culture of Homo Sapiens until they left Africa and met the 
Neanderthals. It is now known that the two species met and even mated, although 
the nature of their relationship in general is controversial. The theory that Homo 
Sapiens  violently eradicated the Neanderthals is currently doubted.  The Neanderthals 
existed for much longer than H omo Sapiens has, survived the ice age and exhibited 
many skills.  Art always thrives in cultural mixing pots.  
The Venus of Hohle Fels shows a range of entirely unique features as well as several 
characteristics  present in later female figur es. The Venus lacks a head. Instead , an off -
centered, but carefully carved ring is located above the broad shoulders of the figurine. This ring, despite being weathered, preserves polish suggesting that the figurine was 
worn as a pendant. Beneath the shoulders, which are roughly as thick as they are wide, 
large breasts project forward. The figurine has two short arms with two car efully 
carved hands with visible fingers resting on the upper part of the stomach below the 
breasts. 
The Venus has a short and squat form with a waist that is slightly narrower than the 
broad shoulders and wide hips. Multiple deeply incised horizontal lines cover the 
abdomen from the area below the breast to the pubic triangle. Several of these 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         203 
horizontal lines extend to the back of the figurine and are suggestive of clothing or a 
wrap of some sort. Microscopic images show that these incisions were created by 
repeatedly cutting along the same lines with sharp stone tools. The legs of the Venus 
are short and pointy. The breasts, buttocks and genitals are exaggerated and depicted 
in more detail. In addition to the many carefully modelled  anatomical features, the 
surface of the Venus preserves numerous lines and deliberate markings.  
Many of the features, including the emphasis on sexual attributes and lack of emphasis 
on the head, face and arms and legs, call to mind aspects of the numerous Venus 
figurines well known from the European Gravettien, which typically date between 
22,000 and 27, 000 years ago. The careful depiction of the hands is reminiscent of 
those of Venuses including that of the archetypal Venus of Willendorf, which was 
discovered in 1908. Despite the far greater age of the Venus of Hohle Fels, many of 
its attributes occur in various forms throughout the rich tradition of Paleolithic female representations. 
The figure, about 2.4 inches tall, was carved from a mammoth tusk.  The intricate 
detailing achieved with primitive stone tools indicates the amount of energy invest ed 
in these little objects— tens if not hundreds of hours.  
I viewed the origin al carving on my last trip to Tü bingen and was given a scale replica 
of it. I decided to create a larger version to see the sculptural forms of the carving 
more clearly, abstracting from the intentional scratching of the surface as well as the 
cracks from assembling the many pieces of th e original find.  
As I worked on the piece, I was impressed at the elegant abstraction of the human 
female form as well as its capture of the maternal stance of the pregnant woman. Early 
humans  during the Ice Age clearly had perception, empathy, concern and 
craftsmanship  that would rival that of contemporary people.

Friends  had commissioned me to make a sculpture for them and I thought for some 
time about doing a sculpture of a bird, since they loved birds, particularly owls. One 
day, browsing through pictures I had taken of pre -Columbian sculptures in a museum 
in Ecuador in  2013, I came upon my favorite of the collection and started to research 
it on the Web.  
Here is the photo I took —as well as a collection of other Valdivian stone sculptures : 
    
This carving is one of the earliest known sculptures in the Americas, a Valdivian stone 
carving from Ecuador. Valdivian stone figures are rectangular in shape with delineated 
eyes and features in characteristic minimalist style.  
The Valdivia Culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula 
near the modern -day town of Valdivia, Ecuador, between 3500 BC and 1800 BC.  
First, I carved a sculpture based on the Valdivian owl for my friends. I liked it so 
much, I made another one for my own collection, perched on a branch.  
The Cycladic Figure 
In 2015, I carved a sculpture based on early ancient Greek Cycladic sculpture. The 
wood is English Plane (related to sycamore) from a large tree we had taken down in 
our back yard a couple of years earlier . It was one of several logs that I had the arborist 
cut from the tree before removing the rest by crane. I started carving the log, based 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         206 
on a small copy of a Cycladic sculpture that I had purchased in Greece. During two 
visits, Rusty  assisted in the carving.  
Because my sculpture is based on the Greek marble Cycladic sculptures from the birth of Western sculpture and because of their connection with fertility, I named my 
sculpture “Baby” and dedicated it to Rusty and Sarah's daughter, my second 
granddaughter , Ruby, upon her birth.  
It was at first difficult to achieve the three -dimensional symmetrical form of the 
model. In addition, the quality of the wood see med ragged, so I wondered if I w ould 
be able to get a nice surface or reveal an interesting grain. It was not until the piece 
was completed and oiled that the beauty of the wood was revealed.  
   
The original Cycladic sculptures date back to the Neolithic era of pre -history, between 
5000 BCE and 2400 BCE. They were carved in the finest Greek marble, which is local 
to the Cycladic islands and was later exported to Athens and elsewhere in classical 
Greek times. Little is known about the Cycladic people and their world, although the 
group of islands was a crossroads of the Mediterranean even before sailing ships were 
invented.  
The Cycladic sculptures were likely fertility objects. Most of them represented young 
women of childbearing  age and accentuated their female features. Certainly, they 
involved the life cycle, and are often found in graves.

         207 
   
The Cycladic sculptures all possess certain features: canonical (e.g., folded arms), 
proportional and simplistic. They appear in museums now as pure in their whiteness. 
However, these sculptures were frequently painted. Pigments were used to add detail. 
The only facial feature carved was the nose. The sculptures have all been excavated at 
Cycladic cemeteries.  
The Neolithic and Bronze Age Cycladic figures present an intriguing link between 
prehistoric art and Western art; between the figurines of Galgenburg and Willendorf 
and the sculptures of Brancusi and Modigliani. As Lord Colin Renfrew states of these 
sculptures , “a handsome standing figure, with quiet, unassertive rhythms and balanced 
proportions, achieves one of the most compelling early statements of the human 
form. ”  
 
Is it that there is something incredibly modern about these prehistoric figurine  
sculptures, or has humankind always portrayed the human form in a manner that 
utilizes elegance and simplicity, with figures mastered by style and yet full of life? The 
emotional pitch is achieved by the omissions, distortions and exaggerati ons, and in so 
doing the artist  creates  a tension between the abstract and the real.  
The Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens —a favorite of mine —is dedicated to the 
study and promotion of ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, with special emphasis on Cycladic Art of the fifth millennium BC. It was founded in 1986. Its 
collection is one of the finest collections of Cycladic artifacts in the world.

The Cycladic Islands of Greece are set in the Aegean Sea. The ancient Greeks called 
these islands the Kyklades, a scattered kyklos or circle, of islands around the holy island 
and sanctuary of Apollo: Delos. The Cyclades had rich mineral deposits  and fine 
marble . They were close to each other, which made safe navigation between the 
islands in rowboats easy (sailing ships were only invented ca. 2000 BC). During the 
Early Bronze Age, when people started using bronze for their tools and weapons, a 
sophisticate d culture flourished in the Cyclades that thrived for almost a millennium. 
This period —called Early Cycladic —ranges from 3200 to 2000 BC.  
The Early Bronze Age inhabitants of the Cyclades used their local supplies of premier 
white marble to make both figurines and a variety of stone vases. The development 
of sculpture was one of the most impressive achievements of the Early Cycladic 
culture , no doubt made possible by marble and bronze technolog ies. Archaeologists 
organize the well -known stylized marble figurines in two basic types: schematic and 
naturalistic. The majority of Cycladic figurines represent nude females in standing 
position. Less frequent are models of male musicians, warriors and grou ps of figures 
in a range of postures.  
I took these photos at the Museum during May 2010, when we went on a wonderful  
cruise of the Cycladic Islands to celebrate my 65th birthday:

Pre-Columbian Sculpture  
I have always loved pre -Columbian sculptures and figures —at least since my family 
trip to Mexico when I was 1 7. The Olmec, Maya, Inca  and Aztec cultures all had 
wonderful pottery, masks and carvings.  
The ancient Olmec culture specialized in large stone carvings, which are relatively 
rare. I saw some near Vera Cruz on my honeymoon in 1989 and more during a trip 
to Guatemala in 2014 . The Mayans, Incans and Aztecs  had their pyramid temples with 
relief carvings , stone carvings and pottery incorporating striking images of gods and 
animals.  
Over a dozen Mayan and Aztec sculptures named Chacmool  have been found , dating 
from 800 AD on. The distinctive posture of the Chacmool is what allows the many 
sculptures to be united under one term: the figure reclines on his back, his knees bent 
and his body on a single axis from neck to toes. The elbows rest on the ground and 
support the torso, creating tension as the figure strains to  sit upright. The hands meet 
at the chest, usually holding either a disk  or a vessel, possibly for human sacrificial 
hearts . The head rotates ninety degrees from the axis of the body to present a frontal 
face. This recumbent position represents the antithesis of aggression: it is helpless and 
almost defenseless, humble and acquiescent .

Modern Sculpture  
Brancusi Simplicity 
Constantin  Brancusi (1876 -1957) is the modern ist sculptor who reduced forms to 
their simplest essence. Born in Romania (where my paternal grandparents came from), 
Brancusi was active in Paris during the blossoming of abstract art, partially inspired 
by exotic sculpture of prehistoric and non -European cul tures. 
Throughout my life, I often visited the room in the Philadelphia Museum of Art 
dedicated to Brancusi’s sculptures. I also lingered in Brancusi’s studio, recreated in 
Paris. In particular, I loved the purity and sophistication of Brancusi’s “ Bird in Flight” 
sculpture, which he produced in several media.  
             
Brancusi’s marble sculpture in his atelier, my oak sculpture in Rusty’s living room . 
To reawaken my sculpting after several years of non -use, I challenged myself to 
reproduce “ Bird in Flight” in wood, using a curved white oak limb from a tree in my 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         212 
Philadelphia woodland. I later decided to do a larger version for outside my house in 
Chatham, from a wild cherry limb from my woodlands there.  When I thought about 
teaching a class in ceramic sculpture, I tried modeling Brancusi’s  “Bird in Space ” in 
clay. 
           
Moore Forms 
Henry Moore (1898 -1986) has always been my primary inspiration in sculpture. His 
sculptures have allowed me to see and feel 3 -D form s. 
I have looked carefully at Moore’s sculptures whenever I came across them and have 
run my hands as well as my eyes over their surfaces, textures, curves and edges. I have 
read many books about his sculpture, which mainly involves looking at the pictures , 
which try to capture the 3 -D sculptures in 2 -D photos.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         213 
 
Moore went beyond Brancusi by adding back some of the complexity of organic 3 -D 
forms, while retaining the clarity of the simple underlying forms. 
Moore was one of the pioneers of direct carving (as opposed to the academy’s use of 
pointing tools to mechanically copy models). He was also one of the first sculptors to 
explore holes or negative spaces in sculpture —whether leaving open space between 
forms or actually poking holes in solid masses.  
I have always adopted direct carving and been interested in negative space. I am 
exploring how to go beyond Moore’s holes to open up masses even more, using 
intersecting negative spaces and defining negative spaces with partially surrounding 
positive forms . 
I was long intrigued by a maquette of Moore’s with two holes that looked like eyes in a face. I only knew it from a small photo from one view of it. When I created a ceramic 
sculpture (Eyes Opened Up ) to explore how his piece worked in 3 -D, I ended opening 
up the top to get behind the eyes and then opening up much of the lower body to replace a solid form supporting the piece with a set of structural forms creating a more 
complex negative space below the face. I conceived this as transforming Moore’s 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         214 
“pocking simple holes” into outlining and defining negative spaces by opening up 
larger forms. 
Although Moore was primarily a stone carver, he did a number of wood sculptures. 
My approach to wood carving is quite similar to Moore’s —although of course not at 
his level of artistry and professionalism. Once established, Moore was also able to 
work at a much larger scale  than I can.  
Moore combined 3-D forms in various ways. Sometimes forms were combined to 
resemble human or animal organisms (i.e., structures consisting of multiple organs or 
functional forms). Some of his sculptures were large blocks with decorative or 
symbolic forms in relief on them. In other sculptures, massive forms were joined to 
each other by bone -like connectors. Eventually, Moore assembled forms that leaned 
on one another or stood in relation to each other— whether the forms were actually 
attached  or not.  
In some of my sculptures from 2020 -2022, I combine forms that are or appear to be 
from separate masses (e.g., different logs). In 3-Tiered Structure , for instance, forms 
carved in three different logs are stacked to create a complex of positive and negative 
forms. Perhaps this moves even further from Brancusi’s focus on individual forms 
than Moore moved in his pieces  with multiple interrelated forms.  In addition, my 
structures are studies of the “topology” (see below)  of the connections forming the 
positive  and negative spaces.  
Studies of Giacometti 
Sculptors generally make copies of works by their predecessors. Sometimes the goal 
is to reproduce the original faithfully, to some degree. Other times one adapts a pose 
or technique to a different subject. One can learn enormously by copying the masters. 
In previous times, students of sculpture learned through apprenticing an experienced 
artisan, working under their direction and being trained in their ways of seeing, 
planning, creating, reproducing and marketing sculpture. Copying interesting works 
is a w ay for students today to learn from a variety of experts, who are not personally 
available.  
In Spring 2019 after returning from a stay in Florida away from my studio, I re -
engaged in sculpting by studying the life and work of Giacometti . I read James Lord’s 
lengthy biography and looked at books of photos of his sculptures, which were mainly 
modeled  in clay or wax  and cast in plaster.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         215 
 
In quick succession, I copied several of Giacometti’s sculptures that appealed to me  
(see the section above on my “Giacometti Studies Series .” Most were from his early 
cubist period. I created each piece in clay and then made a rubber mold and cast it in 
plaster. I also fired the original clay version when possible.  
On the way to Florida, I had seen all Degas’ sculptures in the National Gallery in DC. 
So, I did a clay study of his Little Dancer , the only sculpture he displayed during his 
lifetime.

Topology of 3 -D Form  
“Topology” is the logos of topoi, which is Greek for the logical structure or study of 
places, which are spaces defined by materials, such as the surfaces of 3 -D objects. 
There is a field of mathematics devoted to formalizing topology. Euclid had already 
studied regular 3 -D polyhedrons, such as the cone, pyramid, globe and the five 
Platonic solids.  
 
The five Platonic solids.  
For modern topology, these are all topologically identical in that they have a continuous surface separating an inside from an outside. A donut shape, for instance, 
is different, because its surface could not be stretched to form one of the Platonic 
solids  without somehow tearing the surface. I do not find the regular solids very 
interesting sculpturally, except perhaps as bases for stretching into twisted and 
asymmetric forms.  
A simple topological trick is represented by the Möbius Strip sculpture. A Möbius strip 
is a 2 -D band that has its two ends attached following a half twist. A simple band—
either lying flat or with ends attached without the twist —has two sides: a top and 
bottom or inside and outside. However, with the twist, it only has one side! If you  run 
your finger along one side, you end up on what looks like the other side before 
returning to where you started.   
A more obscure trick is represented by the Klein Bottle sculpture. A Klein bottle is a 
bottle shape whose neck is elongated, enters the jar through some fourth dimension, 
passes through the bottle and then flares out to form the body of the bottle. If you 
start at some point on what appears to be the inside su rface of the bottle and move 
along that surface and out the neck, you can come around to what appears to be the 
outside surface of the bottle. Of course, the 3 -D representation of a 4 -D Klein bottle 
requires some artistic liberty.

         217 
 
      
A Möbius strip and a Klein bottle  
Sculpture in the real world is neither 2 -D nor 4 -D, but has an inside (the wood or 
clay) and an outside (the oiled or glazed surface). However, if the sculpture has been 
opened up with negative spaces or surrounded holes, it can have different topological 
structures. For instance, some of my sculptures have zero, one, two or more holes —
making their topological structures mutually incommensurable. Furthermore, sculptures like Mrs. Mayo  and Three -Tiered Structure  have holes that interconnect, 
forming relative ly complex topologies. 
Sculpture, as the working of physical materials in the world, is conditioned by 
structural needs for strength and balance in order to persist and be displayed. The act 
of opening up a piece with significant holes must take these needs into account.  
It is interesting that the Angel of Progress  sculpture, as it winds up from its base, 
maintains two vertical supports at each of three stages. The two vertical supports flow 
out of the horizontal stage below and into the horizontal stage above. At each level, 
the two verticals and two horizontals fo rm a circle framing the hole that is opened up 
there. The three topologically distinct openings are located at angles above each other, together defining an imaginary vertical negative space where the core of the  log had 
been. Maintaining a pair of supports at each stage provides for strength and balance of the overall sculpture, which is delicately balanced and which takes advantage of the 
strength of the log’s vertical fibers. If any one of these verticals were removed, the 
weight of the upper part of the sculpture would produce a destabilizing torque, threatening breakage or collapse.  
The Pod sculpture, by comparison, has three verticals at each stage  (not clearly visible 
in any one 2 -D photo) , providing a considerably more stable structure. The Pod 
features three faces working collaboratively. The support for these faces spirals down 
through various forms, consolidating in three columns from the upper half of the 
sculpture that sit atop three columns from the bottom half. The bottom rests again 
on three legs. Maintaining a trio of support at each vertical level provides for 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         218 
substantial stability, avoiding the careful maintenance of balance needed in the Angel 
of Progress . This allows the Pod to support heavier, more massive forms.  
      
     
Details of Pod illustrating tripod support structure and geometric elements.  
The Three -Tiered Structure moves from five supports at the floor, to four 
connections between Tier #1 and Tier #2, to three connections between Tier #2 and 
Tier #3, to a single arch at the top rising from its two  legs. A variety of openings are 
formed by these supports and the forms they flow into. 
In a contrasting approach, the Hickory Bivalve  is balanced on a small central base. This 
sculptural trick makes the sculpture seem to float without support. This requires a 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         219 
strong hidden bolt anchoring the sculpture to a broad base. Similarly, Saddle Curve  is 
balanced on a single narrow support. However, in this case the sculpture was designed 
with a strong sense of internal balance. The sculpture has no separate base, but stands 
on a broad, three- toed foot that is integral to the design. The support sectio n is a 
sculptural curve, a twisting 3 -D parabolic form. The surface of the top -heavy upper 
part is a saddle curve, a topologically significant 2 -D manifold . The saddle point —
near the center of the log’s grain pattern —is a local high point in one direction and a 
low point in the perpendicular direction, like a horse -riding saddle that slopes up in 
the front and back of the rider and slopes down on the sides under the legs. In calculus terms, a saddle point is simultaneously a rela tive maximum and minimum. In the 
sculpture, this surface is used to display the visually interesting grain that evolved at 
the base of the cherry tree, just above root ground level. To accomplish this,  the log 
was flipped wide side up, requiring a supporting form that would provide adequate 
stability.

saddle curve of Saddle Curve .  
Sculptures with more complex topological structures may include interconnected 
openings. An early attempt at this was my Hermaphrodite. It has two vertical supports 
forming an elongated opening, which are then connected to an opening from above. 
Bite of the Apple  adds another opening, so that holes from four of the six perpendicular 
axes meet in the thereby opened up center of the piece. Similarly, Return of the Osprey  
has four openings that join in the middle of the log. Sly Eye has two openings defining 
the spiraling middle area of the rear of the piece entering into a cavernous opening of 
the wood’s mass from the front. Mrs. Mayo  features a more involved set of openings, 
including some largely hidden holes down the center, linking multiple openings. The inside/outside relations of Hinged Forms  are rather ambiguous, depending on whether 
the hinge is open or not; they can be seen as reducing the wood almost to an outline structure defining connected negative spaces, most notably the center of the log, for 
which opening the hinge provides easy access for the carving and the observation.  
The view of sculptural material as structures defining negative forms comes from my ceramic models and sculptures. See the section on my Negative Structures Series, 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         220 
featuring the following: Slab Sculpture 1, Slab Sculpture 2, Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture with 
Grog and Negative Structure.  Here, the interconnected openings are too involved to 
easily count or describe. The approach shifts from opening up a solid mass to creating 
open space s by defining their boundaries.  
At the end of 2021, I returned to sculpting after taking a break to complete some 
publications. I decided to extend my topological exploration of sculptural structures 
with a three -tiered wood sculpture. I began with a series  of clay maquettes to get a 
feel for appropriate 3-D forms and connecting structures. I explored possible 
structures in clay for a couple of months. I then carved three logs from a large local 
pine tree that had been knocked down a few years earlier by a hurricane. The final 
structure r ises through 4, 3, 2 and then 1 upright structures. A number of distinct 3 -
D forms are connected by a network of structures and negative spaces.  The wooden 
forms differ from the clay forms, but incorporate structural understandings that I 
gained from the ceramic maquettes.  
Working in clay —such as the maquettes —involves different gravitational— and 
hence topological —considerations than carving wood. The clay must  hold its own 
weight as it dries and is fired, as well as balance properly as a finished piece. Clay 
structures are built up, whereas wood is carved away. So extreme opening up of 
negative spaces by reducing positive forms to a minimum involves adding clay  until 
it is strong enough versus removing wood without making it too fragile to withstand 
checking during drying or breaking under stress. Ceramic sculptures can be built up 
from spans of clay coils or elongated slabs, whereas wood sculptures are carved o ut 
from solid logs. Although the results are often quite different, I often create ceramic 
models that I can hold in my hand, easily view in 3 -D and quickly refine their masses, 
openings or connections. Such maquettes then inspire and guide the creation of  wood 
sculptures requiring a hundred  times as much time and effort. In this way, topological 
insights from one medium influence work in the other material. This is an important aspect of the dialectic between material and manipulation in sculpture.  
Sculptural topology —the structural logic of 3 -D form in matter like clay or wood —
contrasts with mathematical topology or geometry, although there are linkages between them. For instance, Pod and Saddle  Curve  incorporate lines, circles, triangles 
and curves, incorporating them however in masses that flow into one another in 
organic rather than mechanical or stylized ways. Mathematical and industrial figures 
are abstractions from physical objects; sculpture makes visible what is lost in such 
abstraction.

5. Space: Opening Up 3-D Form 
As discussed in the following chapter  on my sculpting techniques —as well as in the 
section on “Negative S tructures  Series” in the second chapter , above —a frequent  goal 
of my carving or modeling is to open up the material. The aim may be partially to 
supply  views into the heart of the mass —revealing swirling grains in heartwood, for 
instance. It may also offer a view of the internal structure, such as supports in clay or 
plaster pieces. Furthermore, it adds considerable complexity, asymmetry and 
formation to  the sculpture. Thereby, it suggests and invites more ways to observe the 
piece visually and tactually.

However, the primary effect of opening up a mass is on the space of the piece: the space around the piece and the spaces within the piece:  
Space is the place  
in which sculpture opens up.

In sculpture, the term “negative space” is often used to specify how a hole in a 
sculptural mass can be viewed as itself having a form —the negation of the form of 
the mass. Wittgenstein illustrated the phenomenon of “seeing as” either positive or 
negative spaces in simple drawings:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         223 
 
Faces/vase drawing. The white positive space of the vase creates a black negative space of 
two faces looking at each other. By shifting v isual focus, you can see it in either one way or 
the other. 
In a sculpture, one can simply poke a hole, opening the mass with a negative space, 
or one can fashion the opening as an interesting interior form. The inner negative 
space can be integrated with the surrounding exterior negative space, so that the 
positiv e space of the sculpture’s surface flows from its outside into its interior.  
 
Holes . Red clay and paint. 2017. Based on a stone sculpture by Barbara Heppenworth, a 
contemporary of Henry Moore. This was a simple attempt by me   at creating  several holes 
in a cylindrical form and letting their spaces merge inside.  
Moore, Heppenworth  and others started by poking holes and then enlarging them 
into negative forms. I sometimes try to take this further, so that the positive and 
negative forms become equally important aspects of the sculpture. One can then view 
the sculpture as consisting primarily of open spaces defined by positive forms. The 
forms of the spaces then become paramount. For instance, there can by multiple open 
forms, flowing into each other, partially contained by positive forms.

The concern with opening up sculpture has evolved during my years sculpting. My 
first wood sculpture, Gelassenheit , did not open the original log at all, but let it be, and 
followed the lines of the log, simply defining interesting flowing contours that brought out the colorful grain of the black walnut. The next one, Twisted Sister, defined a 
negative space between i ts spiraling legs. Two natural holes from knots in the wood 
provided negative spaces like eyes.  
Then I did a plaster sculpture that was quite open, structured by chicken wire framing 
holding the plaster, which was soaked on rags. This piece not only had two short legs 
with space between them, but many openings that flowed from the exterior into the 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         225 
interior. The inside was structured with ropes to add interest to the inside, like nerves 
within a body  or brain. The openings from the outside merged into this complex 
internal space.

Some 15 years later, I carved the Owl of Minerva. Again, it had two shapely legs defining 
a 3-D negative space that twisted between them. It also had an open form that defined 
the owl’s wooden beak and poked through the back of the head to suggest an eye.   
    
Below, where I discuss how I carve the Open Cherry Trunk and Upright Cherry Figure , 
one can see the process of gradually opening up a log to create a unity of positive and 
negative spaces.

My most open wood sculpture is Mrs. Mayo . I discuss in the following chapter that I 
purchased new tools and developed a new approach to carve this sculpture. The 
Hickory Bivalve , which preceded this carving, was also opened up extensively. In 
particular, the openings in Mrs. Mayo  interweave and permeate the piece. The positive 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         228 
forms that remain can be “seen as” largely containment structures that define the 
boundary between interior and exterior spaces.

After opening up these wood sculptures, I decided to try creating ceramic sculptures 
that also open spaces. I thought it might be easier to create internal spaces using clay.

of negative spaces. My first attempts at this were Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2 , Slab 
Structure 3, Sculpture with Grog and Negative Structur e.

These abstract ceramic explorations influenced my subsequent wood sculptures. I 
first modeled quick clay maquettes to try out approaches in 3 -D to opening up the 
logs. Following are some of these studies:

A special approach to opening up space used the Klein Bottle from topological 
mathematics. It is a 4- D closed manifold that has no differentiation of interior and 
exterior. I created a 3 -D representation using clay coils.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         240 
 
There are some auxiliary windows to allow one to look inside, but they do not belong 
to the Klein Bottle. The large round hole facing dow n in the front is the opening of 
the tube that comes out the top, circles around, enters the main bottle at the back and then opens out the front. (The way the tube enters at the back is topologically illegal 
in 3-D, but takes artist’s license to account for only being able to create 3 -D forms in 
this world.) If you start from a point “inside” the bottle, you can proceed up the tube, 
around and out the front into the “outside” without crossing any surface, so that 
inside and outside are the same continuous space .  
The trick in opening up the inside this way is that the tube actually does penetrate the 
surface of the bottle in the back. In 4 -D it could enter without breaking the surface, 
in analogy with the Mobius Strip, which is a 2- D manifold that only has one surf ace 
in 3-D space. (See my ceramic Mobius Strip .)

6. Pr actice:  Sculpting 3-D Form in 
Wood  
Tools and Techniques  
I generally start with a log and a challenge. The two go together. For instance, if my 
challenge is to create a wooden sculpture that recreates some of the form of Brancusi’s 
Bird in Flight , then I need a log or branch that is long, thin and curved at one point. 
Perhaps the log comes first and suggests the challenge. Alternatively, t he log may 
contain the shape of a human head or a body with two or four legs.  
I like to create large sculptures  (almost on the scale of the human body) , so one can 
see and feel the forms easily. For practical purposes , I am limited to logs that are small 
enough and light enough for me to move around, perhaps with a hand truck, a lever 
or a friend.  
From my first wood sculpture to my last, I have used the  same tools to shape the 
form —literally the same physical large gouge and mallet. The gouge chips away 
chunks of wood about one square inch across and curved below. Hundreds of these 
gouge cuts provide the rough surfaces of the sculpture. I then use a foot -long 
Sureform rasp to smooth out the gouge marks and to create my characteristic long 
flowing curves. Typically, one form on the sculpture flows into another along curves 
refined by this rasp. Each o f the major forms in the sculpture is asymmetric, looking 
unexpectedly different from each angle of observation.  
If one looks at a sculpture as it is literally “taking shape” as an organism (an 
assemblage of multiple organ -like 3 -D forms), then the question arises of how to join 
the distinct forms together. This question is partially answered in the technical process  
of refining and smoothing the individual forms and the transitions between them. The 
rasp helps to define smoothly flowing, minimalist transitions between them like those 
found in bones and animal bodies.

         242 
   
My original mallet, gouge and rasp. Hand carving tools, including rifflers.  
Once the sculpture is well defined by the gouge and the rasp, the surfaces are refined 
to feel silky smooth to the touch, almost like skin. This is accompl ished with smaller 
rasps or riff lers—to get into the tight spots where the Sureform cannot reach —and 
by sandpaper. I typically use 4 or 5 successive grades of sandpaper, from very rough  
50-grade to super smooth 300 -grade wet -and dry. The final sanding is interspersed 
with oiling.  
I have always finished my sculptures with Tung oil. I used to mix my own Tung oil 
and boiled linseed oil, but now I use a commercial Wetlox blend, which works well  
for all wood surfaces . I give the sculpture at least three or four coats of oil, rubbed 
with the wet sandpaper. Sometimes, a sculpture can use another coat of oil after a 
year. 
 
My electric tools: chains aw, drill, belt sander and rout er. 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         243 
Gradually, I have begun to use electric tools to rough in and help shape the logs. For 
instance, in creating Mrs. Mayo , I wanted to open up the log and have interconnected 
opening s going throughout the scul pture. First, I created clay ma quettes or models of 
the log with various openings. In particular, my challenge was to rough in the 
sculpture with a chain saw, which can only cut long, straight cuts. I bought a chain 
saw that would be safe for sculpting. I also got a strong hand drill wi th large bits for 
drilling long or wide holes.  
   
Model s of Mrs. Mayo , featuring openings for chainsaw cuts. Holes drilled in base and leg of 
Mrs. Mayo  sculpture.  
A technical reason for wanting to open up the whole structure of Mrs. Mayo  was that 
the wood was still green, as the tree had just been felled. I started carving  right away, 
rather than waiting five to ten years for the wood to gradually dry from the inside out. 
Opening the log up so that no part was more than three or four inches thick reduced 
the chances of the wood splitting or checking as it dried and shrank f rom the outside. 
Although there was some checking while I carved the piece, it stopped as soon as I 
oiled it to seal the outside. Thus, the opening up process combined aesthetic, technical 
and practical issues of form, tools and materials.

Holes drilled for eyes. Hole (see light circle in center) drilled from middle of sculpture down 
to legs. 
Now I work in a studio  in my basement  that combines a carpentry workshop with a 
wood sculpture studio and a clay studio. As the need arises, I clear out an area to make 
a workspace for wood, clay, plaster, molds or photography.  
For many years, I have used a jigsaw, a belt sander and a router for creating sculpture 
bases and for doing some of the smoothing work on sculptures. Now, I can fluidly 
combine tools and techniques from carpentry, sculpture and ceramics.  
   
The ceramic and carpentry sections of my workshop . 
I often create small clay models of sculptures I have in mind. This is extraordinarily 
useful in getting a feel for the 3 -D forms, which are impossible to imagine in one ’s

         245 
mind and to understand how the different perspectives fit together.  The human mind 
is shockingly weak at understanding 3 -D forms. Imagining complex sculptures 
without a good model is wickedly difficult, even with perspectival sketches or photos.  
For instance, I wanted to carve a log I had cut down specifically with a favorite wood 
sculpture by Moore in mind. I had several photos of the sculpture; even an entire 
book devoted to Moore’s process of creating that particular sculpture. However, I 
found it impossible to plan my carving until I made a rough plasticine clay model. Then I decided to make a larger, more accurate clay model using sculpting clay.  
 
Study of Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure: Holes . 
It was surprisingly difficult to get the different perspectives from multiple photos to 
meld together. I discovered a lot about the three -dimensionality of Moore’s sculpture 
from making the model. In particular, I learned about the positive and negative sp aces 
in the interior of this opened up form, significantly entitled Reclining Figure: Holes . 
In the end, after making several clay models, I concluded that the heavy log I had 
moved from Philadelphia to Chatham  was not appropriate for a figure like Moore’s. 
I rotated the log and began to open it up using all my tools to create interesting 
negative spaces and exterior forms. Eventually, it evolved into my final sculpture of 2019: Return of the Osprey . This was my most complex sculpture to date, with many

positive and negative forms flowing in and out of each other.  (See section below on 
“Opening Up a Wood Log.”)

Creating a Set of Oak Sculptures  
It was a dark and stormy night in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, when I heard a loud 
crash in the middle of a torrential lightning storm. The next morning , I found that a 
large limb from a two -hundred -year-old oak tree had been flung by the storm against 
our garage wall and had smashed an open window to pieces. After I sawed up the 
heavy branch and dragged the logs off to our woodpile, it struck me that this  was a 
gift from heaven. I was just starting a sabbatical from teaching and the logs inspired me to make time now to return to my wood carving after a hiatus of more than a 
decade. 
  
It is usual to let wood dry out slowly , so it does not check and split. But I knew that 
dry oak would be hard to carve and that I could make much faster progress if I carved 
the wood while it was still green and then treated it carefully so that it would dry 
without checking. This worked amazin gly well. I carved the sculptures so that no 
volume would be too thick, so that outside layers would not dry out faster than 
interiors and cause strains. I was able to finish the carving before the freezing nights of winter came, and I oiled the sculptures well to prevent rapid drying and cracking.  
(I later learned that Moore had also become impatient with the years it would take to 
dry out the large tree trunk he had for his Reclining Figure: Holes . He took a similar 
approach of carving the green wood and protecting it from checking.)  
I mad e four sculptures from the oak and then went on to carve a more ambitious 
piece from a cherry tree log that a friend had brought me from his back yard in Illinois. The creation of these sculptures is documented here. 
The first sculpture I did was relatively simple, to ease me back into the process. I took  
as a goal  the elegant, elongated  form of Brancusi's Bird in Flight, which he had cast in 
metal. I challenged myself to see how well I could reproduce this from a log. Brancusi 
had reduced the image of a bird in flight to a simple, abstract, streamlined form. As I 
worked on it, I discovered the subtle complexity of his form and adapted it to the log 
I worked on, which I had selected for this project.

the original log, (b) the log carved by gouge and mallet,  (c) the piece smoothed with the 
Sureform rasp, and (d) the final sanded and oiled sculpture.  
The next sculpture was also an upright form, but I wanted to open it up. In earlier  
pieces, I had found that a vertical opening could be formed as the pairing of two 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         249 
vertical masses  (like legs) , with the opening scooped out between them and defining 
them as separate forms. This time I added an opening from above, so that the negative 
form from above flows into the opening below. I tried to develop contrasting forms 
coming out the top to add to t he asymmetry of the piece —resulting in a vaguely 
male/female contrast, supported by a lower -leg-like femur structure.

The third sculpture was based on the principle that a sculpture should be compact 
enough to roll down a hill without its parts breaking off. I started with a football shape 
that one could cuddle in one ’s lap, like a cat with its head stretching out to be rubbed. 
The concavity that opened the form without penetrating it was based on a water -
polished rock I found during my explorations at Lake Powell earlier that summer. I 
left the bottom rounded so that t he piece could be held, fondled, and then set down 
to rock and find its own center of gravity. The beak -like ending of the elongated neck 
gave the piece a strong resemblance to a Mexican duck sculpture that I always 
treasured .

balanced in motion.

Creating an Open Cherry Trunk  
My last sculpture of the year 2010 was more ambitious  than the four oak pieces . The 
log consisted of  the starts to  four branches , so I turned it upside down and used three 
of them for legs. Again, I wanted to open the wood up to get away from the simple 
log shape and to explore the interior of the cherry tree. I broke through two cavernous 
openings from the back and scooped out much of the mass in the front, behin d and 
below a prominent beak form that emerged from the fourth branch.  
The openings once more evolved from holes in the wood to spaces surrounding new 
positive forms defined by the negative spaces. They contributed to a spiraling motion 
that I used to animate the log. I then added decorative touches to enliven the piece further: a piercing eye next to the beak and a flowing channel to add to the spiral. The 
feet were given various pointed forms to lift the piece off its base. All of this emerged 
gradually as I worked on the wood and studied its development and its needs. Cherr y 
wood has a variety of structural details, which I tried to uncover and retain, from beautiful patterns just below the bark to interior crevices filled with sap  or resin .

Creating an Upright Cherry Figure  
In the summer of 2000, I attended a conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A friend 
had brought along  in his pickup truck a large  cherry wood limb from a tree in his back 
yard in Illinois. He intended to bring it to my home  in Boulder, Colorado,  since he 
knew I liked to carve wood. I helped him on the drive and we read about philosophical 
controversies involving intersubjectivity to pass the time. Fifteen years somehow 
passed until I both wrote an essay on intersubjectivity and carved the log.  
At some point during the intervening 15 years, I carved some of the middle area of 
the limb down to 4" x 4" to see what the heartwood looked like. I had thought about 
shaping the log in a bone form, like a femur with a ball -and-joint socket. When I lost 
weight, I thought of carving a long, thin image of myself. I probably considered other 
ideas, but never started on any of them.  
On September 28, 2015, I decided to start removing some areas of the log to begin 
to break away from the original log shape , which is still visible in the following  
pictures . Also visible are the cuts I made with a chainsaw to facilitate carving out the 
areas.  
 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         255 
 
Over the next several days of carving, I roughed out the forms of the sculpture using 
my favorite large gouge and mallet. That was good exercise.  
 
 
  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         256 
 
At this point, I had roughed in some of the bone form and the ball for the joint. 
However, the sculpture still looked too log -like and symmetrical to me. I felt a need 
to break through the solid log cylinder. This would also cut through levels of grain to 
the darkly colored heartwood, just as my carving had begun to do in various areas of 
the log. So , I drilled some starter holes with my electric drill and then gouged out a 
passageway through the cylinder. As I integrated this into the sculpture, twisting asymmetries began to evolve  and a larger variety of forms took shape, adding 
considerably to the interest of the scu lpture, without dest roying its unity.  
 
People sometimes ask if I have an image of the sculpture in my head before I start to 
work on it (the Platonic theory) or if I just let the image that is inherent in the log 
come to light ( Michelangelo’s  claim). It is really much more of an emergent process 
that takes place through the direct carving techniques I use. Certainly, I start with 
some ideas that I want to explore and I start with a log that has interesting potentials. 
But the interaction betwe en material and eye incorporates  these in a much more  subtle 
interaction. If one works from a model or from the nature of the log, then you have to wonder why that model  (and pose) or that particular log (and orientation) was 
selected; t here is generally some rough vision  at work, although it may be substantially 
transformed as it gets worked out and evolves through the various stages of 
development.  
Since I do not try to represent  or re- present  some model or objec t, I am free to 
explore, modify and  refine to achieve various goals. I am interested in defining 3 -D 
forms, which look quite different from alternative  vantage points and which guide the 
caressing hand. I turn the worked -on sculpture around frequently and feel the volume 
and flow of the contributing forms with my hands. I love the beauty of wood as an 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         257 
organic product of growth, so my carving explores its layers of grai n and its unique 
twists. I use  natural Tung wood oil as a finish to keep the wood alive and lustrous. It 
comes alive with the oiling and comes into its own final appearance. With periodic 
oiling, a wood sculpture can live indefinitely long, at least for centuries.  
Because of the organic nature of my sculpture and its constituent forms, the finished 
works often remind people of natural and even human figures. In part , this is because 
my forms and their interconnections tend to follow the laws of organic growth. They exhibit a massing, sense of materiality and sensuousness of form , which may feel 
familiar from objects in the world. The forms are  appealing to the eye and the touch , 
partly because they are both similar and, in certain ways, different from natural 
objects .  
It is interesting that my first two wood sculptures are particularly suggestive to many 
viewers. People often say Gelassenheit  looks like an elephant, although I avoided 
imposing any representative forms on that log. Rather, I tried to make the forms look and feel massive. I guess that elephants also have massive forms ( large head, powerful 
trunk, floppy ears, sturdy legs, lumbering body). And Twisted Sister always reminds 
people of ET, although the movie came out a couple of years after the sculpture was 
finished. Apparently, the degree of abstraction from the human figure is similar in the 
two figures —and the eyes of both are appealing . 
Sculpture is a unique art form in that it is three -dimensional. It not only fills and 
shapes space, but it creates a special space ( Heidegger's theory) in which it s event of 
“presencing ” unfolds. Whereas painting only suggests perspective and tricks  the eye, 
sculpture beckons the observer's body to interact and move around the piece, taking 
up infinite different physical perspectives on it. People  are much more oriented to 
sight than to any other sense for observing and understanding the world. Vision is two-dimensional, capturing only that side of objects that currently face us. Perhaps 
infants, who put things in their mouth to explore them, or blind people, who touch 
surfaces, have more of a 3 -D sense. However, it seems that the human brain is 
primarily wired (or trained) to understand 2 -D forms much better than 3 -D forms. 
Creating and experiencing sculpture may provide a corrective to this rather severe 
limitation. 
While impressionist painting began to display the materiality of light, paint and 
brushstroke, wood sculpture brings out the nature of the wood: its size, shape, weight 
and volume, but also its roughness (or smoothness) of surface and the unending 
complexity of its coloring and graining. The growth history of trees like oak an d cherry 
are intricate on many scales and they are captured in the cell structure and displayed in the grain of the sculptural surface.

         258 
 
 
After I roughed in the 3- D forms of the log, I used  a large rasp to remove the gouge 
marks and to refine the curving surfaces. All my wood sculptures have been created 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         259 
using the same basic tools and techniques. This gives a unity to my wood sculpture 
gallery— along with a diversity based on different tree species, sizes and shapes. My 
pieces have smooth flowing surfaces, in part due to the large rasp work.  
Rasping was followed by sanding. I started with #5 0 rough sandpaper to smooth the 
surfaces. And gradually worked up to #1000 very fine sandpaper as well as wet -and-
dry sandpaper and #0000 very fine steel wool to give the surface a smooth touch.

Finally, I oiled the wood with pure Tung oil. This brought out the incredible color of 
the cherry wood, which I had worked so hard to reveal as the forms cut across the 
multi -color bands of grain. I oiled the scu lpture each day for several days, rubbing it 
with a cloth and preparing for each coat with the steel wool.

The sculpture took about three weeks to create . Most days I worked on it for a couple 
of hours. 
After a sculpture is finished and displayed, it generally ripens in color or darkens over 
time. Cherry wood , in particular , develops a deep red tone that continues to mature 
for years.   
On November 3, I took the sculpture out in the back yard to get some sunshine.

Opening Up a n English Plane Log 
When we took down a towering English Plane tree leaning out over the koi pond and 
threatening our house in Philadelphia, I had the arborist save a log from a bend near 
the top of the trunk. I had in mind carving it based on a favorite Henry Moore 
sculpture  from a huge elm trunk, Reclining Figure: Holes . This was a complicated 
undertaking, so I put it off for almost a decade. Then I did a few clay models to understand the overall structure in 3-D, including the many  holes opening it up, which 
were important enough for Moore that he named  his piece accordingly.  
However, when I finally got up my nerve to tackle the log, I soon discovered that it 
would not work  as anything like Moore’s sculpture. So , I re-oriented the log upright 
and decided to just follow the lead of the evolving structure. I made some chainsaw 
cuts to define rough features and then I started to drill out s everal  openings through 
the log to open it up. I used approaches I had developed in working on smaller 
abstract ceramic sculptures. I then carved the openings of the holes to flow through 
the pie ce from the exterior curves and forms.  
As I worked on the log with my gouge, numerous 3- D forms emerged, intricately 
connected and leading in and out of the holes. On the top was a dramatic slab of wood, which I decided to carve into the head of an osprey, giving my sculpture the 
name “ Return of the Osprey .” 
Ospreys are graceful large raptor birds that are again becoming common on Cape 
Cod. In recent  decades, ospreys almost died out. DDT pesticides being used for 
farming and gardening were affecting the eggs of ospreys, so that most of the ir eggs 
broke prematurely. With the banning of DDT, the osprey population i s now returning 
from the brink of human -caused extinction. I celebrate  their return with my sculpture, 
recognizing one instance in which people reversed their ecologically destructive 
practices in time to do some good.  
This sculpture turned out to be one of my largest (and heaviest), as well as my most 
complex works. The opening up of the log involves large and interconnected 
passageways, most of which flow into the surrounding outer curves and forms. While 
the overall s hape of the piece may portray an upright bird perched on its nest, with 
sharp beak ready for fishing, the details require running one ’s fingers along individual 
transitions between forms and peering into the interior from different angles in 
diverse lighti ng. It takes time and effort to understand the sculpture. 
Because of its skewed balance and considerable mass, the sculpture is bolted to a 
heavy base, carved from an oak cross- section gifted by Holly in Maine, via an oak 
board attached to the sculpture’s bottom.

Creating an Angel in Space  
After returning from Florida at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I sheltered in my 
basement studio and focused on casting ceramic sculptures. Then I spent August 
carving the trunk of a cherry tree that Alan and Bill had cut down and saved for me.  
I started by roughing the log in with a chainsaw, guided by a 10" clay model. This 
allowed me to remove large masses of the cylindrical log to start to define a structure 
of limbs spiraling up from a base, as well as to poke through a series of interconnected 
openings going completely through the log. Prominent features  of the angel were also 
roughed in: head, chest, abdomen.

The wings are an add -on from a board. This was suggested by totem  poles from the 
Northwest, which attach wings to thunderbirds. The base is a rough log from a pine 
tree that was downed at a neighbor’s house during a hurricane. I cut chunks of the 
large pine trunk and trimmed one down for this base, which is entirely shaped by the 
chainsaw. The base was needed to raise the angel and to stabilize its potent ially top -
heavy mass.  
 
The theme, Angel of Progress, comes from Walter Benjamin’s 9th Thesis on the 
Philosophy of History:  
“A Klee painting named ‘Angelus Novus’ shows an angel looking as though 
he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His 
eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one 
pictures the angel of history. His fa ce is turned toward the past. Where we 
perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, 
awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is 
blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence 
that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him 
into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before 
him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. ” 
In 1940, when fascism enveloped Europe, eventually leaving him no escape but 
suicide, Benjamin wrote this set of theses, questioning the Marxist optimism about 
historical progress. The “Angel of the New” is caught in a chaotic storm, which 
prevents a forwa rd-looking view and dumps an ever- growing pile of debris at his feet.

In the apotheosis of governmental lawlessness, unrestrained health pandemic, 
potential financial collapse, increasing economic inequality, ideological division and 
impending climate change, it seemed to me time to ponder an angel of progress again. 
My newer angel is inscrutable, looking neither forward nor backward, expressing 
neither hope nor redemption, blankly hovering amidst whatever may come or go  or 
pile up . The winds blow through her, and she persists with the solid material of wood 
that lives on aft er its trees are gone.  
      
Like my other recent wood sculptures, I aimed to open up space and escape the solid, symmetric cylindrical form of the original log. In particular, I built upon the approach 
to multiple intersecting openings in Mrs. Mayo  and Return of the Osprey . While the foot 
of the sculpture retains the circumference of the log, the base it sits on extends outside to broaden the space somewhat. The wings reach out even much further, to open , 
define and pierce  a larger encompassing space, without pretending to be an entir ely 
integral part of the original log. 
The negative forms of the openings and of the cutaways that lead to them define 
positive structural limbs that support the angel -like legs, spiraling around a central 
hollow. The forms of these legs result largely from the studies of structure in my abstract ceramic sculptures. As indications of structure, the positive forms of the 
lower part of the sculpture indicate or outline the  angel’s hips and legs, while removing 
their gravitational mass and allowing the body to flow lightly around and to suspend 
the figure almost in flight.

The forms that enclose the central openings of the lower half of the angel are masses 
designed to reveal the power and beauty of the cherry wood. Note, for instance, how

         273 
thin some of the joints are where structures merge into each other. The curves and 
angles of these forms are designed to bring out the grain of the log, which grows in 
concentric rings following the vertical of the log. To expose interesting grain patterns , 
one must cut into the log and even across the log (as atop the head).

Con-Struction in M useum  of Art  Exhibit 
Sculpture accepted for the international juried exhibit “In Tandem” at the Cape Cod 
Museum of Art, May 10 - July 30, 2023.  
“Con -Struction .” Sculpture from a single cooper beech tree log, on sycamore base. Created in 
Chatham, MA, January 2023. Base: 11”x 18”, height: 18”. Log found by Tom Getz. Carved as 
five separate forms and mounted in tandem.  
 
The title “Con -Struction” combines the Latin terms for “with” and “fitting together.” 
The five constituent forms of the sculpture fit together with each other to produce a 
composite structure. They work with each other in tandem, becoming individually 
subordinate to the piece as a con -structed unit. While each of the five individual forms 
has some complexity of shape and often includes a small central opening, the sculpture as a whole has many times the complexity and opens up significantly more 
interior space. The whole is greater than the sum of its  parts due to the physical and 
spatial connections through which the parts fit together.  
Since 1976, I have carved wood sculptures with biomorphic or organic three -
dimensional forms, which contrast with the geometric shapes of manufactured 
commodities. Their embodied forms are nuanced and asymmetrical; they present 
different, often surprising views from alternative perspectives. By cutting across the 
growth pattern of the tree, I strive to bring out lively grain patterns. Finishing smooth curves and surfaces with natural wood oil, I revive and preserve the life of the wood. 
In a piece like Con -Struction, the organic parts work in tandem to form an organism, 
which cannot be reduced to the functioning of its individual parts.  
I have increasingly endeavored to “open up” the material of my sculptures during my 
focus on ceramic and wood sculpture since retiring to Cape Cod in 2015. When 
working on logs, this involves piercing into the core wood and creating interior spaces. 
The negative space s of the openings become equally important sculptural forms. They 
allow light and sight to flow into and through the usually opaque volumes. Often, cavernous spaces are created, stimulating primordial images of shelter and endowing 
abstract 3 -D space with elemental form, complex structure and human meaning.  
Con-Struction is the latest in a series of wood sculptures where I have opened up the 
log from a tree by sawing it into two to five segments. I then carved the individual 
segments separately, allowing me easier access to internal areas and facilitating the  
effort of creating negative volumes. In order to maintain a view of how the parts will 
work in tandem, I generally develop a ceramic maquette of the overall intended 
design, working out the positive and negative spaces and relationships for the 
assembled final piece. The specific forms and eventual surfaces of the wood emerge 
largely through  the work of carving, so the finished wood sculpture differs 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         275 
significantly in detail from the ceramic maquette. However, the approach to opening 
up the material and the way the parts work together, abutting each other and framing 
negative spaces, persist  from the conceptual model to the finished product. 
The primary tandem relationship is that of sculptor to sculpture. The sculptor’s 
experienced hand and eye respond to intimate perceptions of the evolving materials and work. Even for someone who has worked extensively in 3 -D, it is challenging to 
plan, visualize and work in the round. Human understanding is primarily formed through 2 -D experiences of visual perception. Thinking deeply about a complex 
object from multiple perspectives requires prolonged interaction with the object as it emerges from its raw materials  ... and even living with the sculpture after it is finished.  
Such interaction builds upon  experience in the many stages of crafting sculpture and 
upon experiments with series of attempts at related aims. Con -Struction benefits from  
my previous carvings that investigated biomorphic form, opening up solids, creating negative space and dividing a log into multiple pieces that work in tandem.

Introduction  
his volume of my assembled works differs from the other volumes of my 
eLibrary in multiple  ways. It does not present writings from my academic 
career but  displays artifacts that I created either as an escape from professional  
labors or following my retirement from academia. Rather than describing the design 
of immaterial software or theories, it  presents  photographs of and comments about 
physical objects —mostly sculptures —which  I fashioned out of materials like wood 
and clay.  
There are chapters on the following aesthetic creations  and approaches : 
1. My wood sculptures from 1976 to the present . Wood sculpture has been my primary 
artistic endeavor during my adult life. Every few years, I did a couple pieces. 
In retirement, I have been more productive. 
2. Clay sculptures and pottery from 1970 to the present . As a young child, my mother 
taught me basic pottery. I enjoyed occasionally working in clay in my 20s and 
always looked forward to doing more. I felt that the medium of abstract clay 
sculpture had much more potential than was represented in the art world, 
even though  clay may be considered one of the oldest surviving artistic medi a 
in the world. The universality of clay work may be attributed to its 
combination of utility and beauty. Retirement has allowed me to explore 
ceramic sculpture in my own studio as well as to take pottery lessons at local art centers.  
3. My houses, which I helped to design  with Carol in Philadelphia, Boulder, 
Philadelphia and Chatham in about 1978, 1997, 2004 and 2015. Having 
designed the Chatham  house incorporating many species of wood , I was 
eager to create wooden furniture to go with the house. The house was designed in 2014/15 and built in 2015/16. I constructed  the furniture in 
2016/17,  and the house was landscaped at that time as well. In 2017/18, I 
turned my basement furniture shop into a productive sculpture studio.  
4. Reflections  on organic form from nature . I strive to create asymmetrical, flowing, 
sensuous, organic forms whose structures are often inspired from human 
forms, animal shapes and other organisms or natural objects . Living by the 
ocean, I have sculpt ed some forms that I fou nd on the beach.  I am fascinated 
with the sophistication of sculptures dating back far into pre -history. I have 
made a few  sculptures based on such works , as well as studies of modern 
sculptors . 
5. Thoughts on opening up space . While my first wood sculptures followed closely 
the original solid form of the ir logs, I increasingly worked on “opening up” 
the mass of wood to peer inside and to create internal spaces , interconnected T

         6 
openings and negative 3 -D forms . Here I collect views of several of my 
sculptures to illustrate  possibilities for “opening up ,” and to indicate the 
development of my approach to this.  
6. The practice of sculpting 3 -D form in wood . This section documents the succession 
of techniques and tools I have often used in my wood sculpture, illustrated 
with photos from the creation of several different works.   
7. A chronological catalog of all my sculptural works, numbering about two  hundred  
all together, of diverse sizes , themes, forms  and materials.

Keep up to date with my sculpture by downloading the latest version of the e -book 
(pdf) at: http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form/form.pdf . The pdf is formatted the 
same as the printed  version. The digital format allows me to continuously add my 
latest items to the catalog and other chapters. Viewing the pdf allows you to search 
the text and zoom in on details of the sculptures.  
Further information about this volume is available at: 
http://gerrystahl.net/elibrary/form . Versions for Kindle  (mobi) and iBooks (epub)  
can be downloaded there, although they are not as up -to-date and well formatted as 
the pdf .  
Go to: https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture  to open a webpage with videos of many  of 
my sculptures. They display the sculpture slowly turning 360º . The videos are brief – 
mostly about half  a minute.  The videos are organized into five groupings:  
• Videos of some of my wood carvings . A catalog of my wood carvings is 
available at:  https://gerrystahl.net/sculpture/carvings . 
• Videos of some of my abstract ceramic sculptures , modeled in clay and fired.  
• Videos of some of my modernist ceramic sculptures , inspired by Rodin, 
Degas, Brancusi, Giacometti, Heppenworth, Moore.  
• Videos of some of my pre -Columbian and prehistoric ceramic sculptures , 
based on artifacts. 
• Videos of some of my realistic sculptures of the human body , based on live 
or photographed models.  
The videos help to display the 3 -D form, the "opening up" of the material , and the 
play of positive and negative space as discussed in this book. The videos are silent. 
You can make the video full screen by clicking on the square icon in the lower right corner of the video image. To return from full screen, click on the same icon or press

1. Sculpture: 3- D Form from Wood  
I began exploring wood sculpture in the mid -1970s.  Wood sculptures continued to 
be my most important sculptural works throughout my life.  Here are two large pieces 
from 2020:  
 
Angel of Progress  and Return of the Osprey . 
Following are my wood sculptures in chronological order.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         18 
Gelassenheit (1976) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         19 
  
Gelassenheit  (Let it be ). Black walnut . Pine Run, New Jersey. 1976. Influenced by Heidegger’s 
ontology of unfolding beings, I  let the character of the log lead me to bring out the beauty of 
its colorful grain and co re. I tried to form interesting sweeping shapes that portray and 
enhance  the strength and solidity of the log ’s mass.

         20 
Twisted Sister (1977) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         21 
  
Twisted Sister . Cherry. Pine Run, New Jersey. 1977. Not influenced by E .T. (which it 
predated). This cherry tree trunk contained knots that became integrated into the sculpture. I 
opened up a space between two legs, which curved asymmetrically to define an interesting 
negative form. On one leg surface, I created a relief based on Indonesian sculptural 
traditions. 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         22 
Atomic Power (1983) 
 
Atomic Power . Cyprus. Philadelphia. 1983. This slab from a large tree was found in a dump of 
tree trunks, cut down by the City. I refined the outline of the slab and poked a hole 
surrounded by carving marks.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         23 
The Owl of Minerva (1995) 
 
The Owl of Minerva . Redwood. Niwot,  Colorado. 1995. Influenced by Hegel. I enjoyed carving 
4x4 redwood posts left from the deck of our Colorado house —easy to carve, retaining good 
edges, sanding smoothly, acquiring beautiful color when oiled and revealing strong, broad 
grain. Here, I not only opened a space between twisting legs, but also a large negative s pace 
at the head, drilling  all the way through to form an eye.  Gift to Alan.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         24 
Female Torso (1995) 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         25 
  
Female Torso . Cottonwood. Niwot, Colorado. 1995.  Influenced by Bliss. A first attempt to 
represent a figure realistically. The sense of 3 -D proportion was achieved primarily by the 
sense of touch.   

Works of 3 -D Form  
         26 
Common Senses (1996) 
 
Common Senses . Redwood and mixed  media. Niwot, Colorado. 1996. A fun project,

Works of 3 -D Form

limits.

2. Ceramics: 3 -D Form from Clay  
Ceramic Sculpture  
 
Bone sculpture , free form sculpture and pointy figure. First ceramic sculptures  I did at my 
first pottery studio session in Yarmouth near Chatham.  Later , coffee “mugs.”  
 
Once I started to create ceramic pieces, I did several exploratory series:  
• Paleolithic and Prehistoric Figure Series  
• Pre-Columbian Figure Series  
• Giacometti Studies Series  
• Negative Structures Series 
• Figurative Modeling Series  
• Facial Portrait Series  
• Sea Forms Series  
They are documented in the following sections.

Paleolithic  and Prehistoric Figure Series  
 
Sculptors can learn a lot by creating studies of works of other sculptors, including 
from historical eras and other cultures. I found it particularly interesting to reproduce 
several of the earliest known sculptures. These are carvings in bone or stone, usually 
representing women, often pregnant. The carvings are impressive accomplishments, 
probably reflecting cross -generational communities of skilled carvers, perhaps 
women.  
Some of these prehistoric artifacts are small or fragmented, so I have tried to create a 
representation of them that is at a scale and level of detail that makes them easy to 
perceive and that brings out their underlying forms. The basic forms of the human  
body have clearly fascinated humans from their first attempts to represent figures in 
whatever materials were available – stone, bone, clay and eventually marble or bronze. 
It is a moving experience to reflect upon reproducing images created tens of 
thousands of years ago, when humans were  creating the first persistent self -
representations that we know of. In particular, the “Venus figures” that repeatedly appear across the populated world throughout millennia suggest the importance of 
widespread, multi -generational cultures involving langu age, tool skills, trade  and inter -
tribal communication.  
[See the section on “Pre -historic Sculptures” in Chapter 4, “ Reflections: Philosophy 
of 3-D Form,” below.]  
Here is a rough timetable of the figures I have tried to reproduce:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         69 
 
40,000-35,000 years before the present (BP), t he Venus of Hohle Fels  (also known as 
the Venus of Schelklingen  or the Tübingen Venus ) is an Upper Paleolithic  Venus figurine  
belonging to the early Aurignacian  culture , and is one of the oldest undisputed 
examples of Upper Paleolithic  art and figurative prehistoric art in general.  It is made 
of mammoth  ivory at the very beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, which is associated 
with the earliest presence of Cro -Magnon humans in Europe (where they mixed with 
Neanderthals  – my own theory is that this mixing of species may have fostered the 
advent of art ). I came across the original figure in the archeological museum  in 
Tübingen  and was given a scale -model reproduction of it by a colleague who was 
friends with the archaeologist.

30,000– 27,000 BP, the Venus of Willendorf  was o riginal carved from an oolitic 
limestone that is not local to the area ; the stone may have come from across the Alps 
or 1,000 miles away. Parts of the body associated with fertility  and childbearing have 
been emphasized. Some hypothesize that such figurines may have been created as 
self-portraits by women, due to the correlation of the proportions of the statues to 
how women's bodies would seem when  looking down at themselves,  and to the lack 
of facial features .

         71 
    
29,000- 25,000 BP, the Venus of Dolni Vestonice -- ceramic  -- oldest known ceramic in 
the world, predating the use of fired clay to make pottery. The figurine was modeled 
from a mixture of clay and tempered bone and then fired . It is one of the first 
examples of ceramics.

27,000- 22,000 BP, the Venus of Laussel R elief. The original “Venus of Laussel” is a 
limestone bas -relief of a woman with the moon, marked off to count the lunar or 
menstrual cycle. Original carved on a cave wall and painted with red ochre.

         73 
 
 
25,000 BP, the Venus of Ostrava  (also known as  Venus of Petřkovice) – the original  
miniature headless female torso – only 5 cm in height – was carved from a piece of 
black hematite iron ore  during the  Gravettian industry culture. Uniquely, the absence 
of the head appears to be the author's intention. Also, unlike other prehistoric Venus 
figurines, it shows a slender young woman or girl with small breasts. It was discovered 
at an ancient settlement of m ammoth hunters.

         74 
    
21,000 BP, the Venus of New Avdeevo . This ivory figurine is generally well preserved. It 
is ten centimeters long with an erect head which has a sculptured face that looks 
forward and is covered by hair or a hat. shoulders are narrow, the chest is flattened, 
and the drop -shaped breasts lie s lightly apart on top of the slightly prominent 
abdomen. The forearms are beneath the breasts, under which the hands appear to be holding the upper part of the abdomen. The fingers are emphasized, and there is a 
bracelet o n one wrist. A band decorated by a wedge -shaped notching is carved on the 
waist. The legs of this figurine are  slightly bent at the knees, below which they are 
separated by a bored hole.  A flattened area around the tailbone of this figurine 
emphasizes the absence of fatty deposits.

7,000- 4,500 BP, the Cylcadic standing figures  carved in marble on the Greek islands. 
These form a transition to the classic Greek sculpture at the start of the history of 
Western art.  
 
2,400 BP,  Nike of Samothrace – Winged Victory . The Nike (Victory) is represented with 
open wings, landing on the prow of a ship. The marble statue together with its base stood over 18 feet high above a sanctuary on the Northeast Aegean island of 
Samothrace , celebrating the victory of Rhodes at sea in 190 BCE. The goddess rests 
on her right leg as she lands. This leg is placed to the fore and draws her torso to the right, in contrast to her lower body which turns to the left. She wears garments that 
billow o ut behind her and double over in folds in front.  The active movement of this 
sculpture contrasts with the rigidity of Egyptian and Babylonian works, which preceded the classic Greek art.

Pre-Columbian Figure Series  
During my travels over my lifetime, I collected sculptures, especially pre -Columbian 
reproductions from Latin America. 
 
On the right are some I collected. On the left are some of what my family called 
“originalis,” small clay figures based on Aztec or Mayan sculptures. Also o n the left,  
an Olmec head that Carol won playing  tennis during our honeymoon in Veracruz and 
a Chacmool that my mother brought me from Mexico.  
Following are a series of ceramic sculptures that I did (lower shelf) based on these 
(upper shelf)  and other pre -Columbian figures in 2019.

         78 
 
The ancient ceramic pieces were made principally using coils and I noticed how small 
coils could be used for eyes and mouth. I also began to experiment with decorative 
finishes on my pieces, inspired by the Latin American cultures.  I sometimes 
referenced their love of gold, jade and turquoise.  As I read about pre -Columbian 
sculpture and ceramics, I was increasingly impressed by the subtle planes of facial 
images: the eye muscles and cheekbones were often modeled in graceful and 
expressive simplicity. Expres sion was conveyed more through decorative clothing and 
accessories than through facial countenance. I tried to adopt and adapt their sense of 
form and decoration.

Giacometti Studies Series  
After the pre -Columbian series, I did a series of studies based on Giacometti’s 
sculpture, especially his early cubist works. I read a lengthy biography of Giacometti, 
as well as books about other modern sculptors  such as Rodin and Degas. I began to 
experiment with making plaster casts of clay pieces as well as working directly in plaster , as Giacometti did .

Negative Structures Series  
As discussed in the chapter below on “Space: Opening Up 3 -D Form,”  much of my 
sculpture is concerned with penetrating the mass (wood, clay, plaster) of matter and 
creating an interior space or negative form within the positive material forms. A series 
of explorations of such negative structures in ceramics resulted in severa l pieces  in 
2008, such as the following: Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2,  Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture 
with Grog and  Negative  Structure . 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         88 
 
 
These ceramic works define spatial forms by creating structural boundaries or 
outlines. They open (create) space primarily by enclosing or surrounding it. Many of 
the spaces are cave -like, hinting at primordial cave rnous  living spaces. Here are some 
from 2022:

         89 
   
    
Complex spaces are interconnected within 3-D, in ways hard to visualize without the 
3-D structure to see, feel and explore. The pieces combine surface texture, volume, 
internal space and structure. Technically, they are constructed to balance the 
constraints of clay strength vs. gravity and span inte grity vs. the effects of shrinkage 
as the clay dries and is fired.

I continued to investigate structure sculptures in my 2021 clay maquettes and 2022 
wood carvings.  Some of these are made in several separate pieces, which are glued 
together in the end to create sparse structures defining open or negative spaces.

Figurative Modeling Series  
My older sculptures were rela tively abstract, non-figurative or  non-representational. 
Although people liked to see animals and other things represented in the sculptures, 
for me they were primarily explorations of abstract 3 -D form. However, once I began 
to work with clay and become more involved in learning about scu lpture, I began to 
take classes and workshops in figurative modeling, that is, capturing the human body 
in whole or in part as realistically as possible.  
I took courses on human portrait (the head), torso and full body. Some of these 
benefitted from live models. Most classes took place over multiple days at the Cotuit 
Center for the Arts, organized by Neil Grant.  
The portraitur e class helped me to see the st ructures of the human head : the bones 
of the skull, the muscles of the eyes and mouth, and the expressive flesh of people at different ages and engaged in talking or other behavior. After this class, I modeled a 
series of masks, presented in the next section.  
 
The workshops on torso and full body were usually two days long. They also stressed 
the structures and forms of the primary layers of skeleton, musculature, flesh and skin 
texture. The first day involved roughing a figure in using clay on a simple wooden 
armature  post. The second day refined the figure and its surface. Then the piece was 
hollowed out so it could dry without breaking from clay shrinkage and so it could 
safely be fired. In two days, I could not create a detailed and polished sculpture, 
captur ing the many aspects of realistic representation. Instead, I aimed at quick

         94 
studies, which  caught the primary forms and retained a rough surface reflecting the 
working of the clay.  
 
The figurative works of reclining models and torsos complemented my other 
explorations of seated figures, such as  Reclining Figure: Holes  Model,  Chacmool , Pregnant 
Mayan  and Nyarit Seated Man .

Eight Ceramic Mask Selfies 
 
These eight self -portrait masks were made in Fall 2019. First, Bob Marcus helped me 
make a life- casting mask of my face from a kit. From the temporary mask, I made a 
plaster mold. Then I pressed slab s of clay into the mold and used the resulting curved 
form s as base s for modeling the clay selfies.  
It is hard to capture a personality in a mask because a person’s unique bone structure 
and muscle configuration changes continuously as they speak and move. The 
expressive muscles around the mouth change the most, but the eye muscles, smile 
wrinkles and ch eek bones also shift significantly.  
So, I tried to make a series of masks with different expressions and sculptural 
techniques. I took pictures of my face in the mirror as my model.  
I experimented with diverse ways  of representing 3 -D facial features. For instance, 
Rodin created undulating waves that seem to press outward from the interior of the 
work. Giacometti amassed small, indistinct bits to define human forms without 
recreating smooth surfaces in order to just provide an impression of the form as seen 
ambiguously from a distance. When I fired the pieces, I sometimes used colored slips to add color to the white, brown or reddish clay.

Sea Forms Se ries 
Since I live by the ocean now, I am interested in exploring natural shapes in forms 
from the sea.  
Seashells fascinate me. They come in complex and beautiful forms, which are grown 
by strange organisms (clams, oysters, etc.) and are often adopted by other organisms 
(such as small crabs) when their original creators outgrow them.  
 
I carved some long, twisting forms based on seashells I found on the beach. 
 
This is a sculpture I did in clay, modeled on a smaller bone from the beach, probably a seal’s 
spinal disk  
Ocean waves are the results of complex interactions of water rushing in different 
directions as well as the slope of the shore  floor. Waves roll in to the beach relentlessly 
and rhythmically. They are calming to hear and watch, in their repetition, endless

from the last wave rolling back into the sea, where it is met by and overpowered by 
the next wave rushing in. The under and over flowing of the opposed movements 
create the breaking wave front. The interaction is so fluid and quick that it is hard to 
follow. Sculpture of a wave front can strive to capture and freeze this ceaseless 
motion.

Casting in Plaster  
Inspired by Giacometti’s plaster sculptures and casts, I decided to try sculpting in 
plaster and ma king plaster casts of clay sculptures. Of course , sculptors primarily  cast 
their sculptures to preserve them and to make multiple copies for sale. Casting in bronze goes back to prehistory. Plaster casting is a less expensive and complicated 
alternative. Today, there are many plastic and resin options  as well . 
Even before reading about Giacometti, I had started to use plaster and to make some 
simple casts with hints from local sculptors (Neil  Grant , Hiram  Ball and Bob  Marcus). 
As an aid to my series of masks, I made one -piece casts of a model skull in clay, and 
I made one- piece clay molds of my Nickerson coins . I also made simple casts of  my 
masks of Ruby and Ora for distribution to relatives.  
When I did the studies of Giacometti, I had to create completely  three -dimensional 
molds , rather  than the one-sided forms for the masks. I started to use EZ -Mix 40 
urethane rubber for the molds and eventually Free -Form Air for two -piece mother 
molds to hold the molds during casting. I switched from plaster of Paris to Hydrocal, a stronger form of plaster. The EZ -Mix 40 liquid rubber was painted onto a clay 
sculpture, which had been waxed as a release. When the rubber hardened, the mold 
had to be slit to tak e out the sculpture. The mother mold was designed to hold the 
slit closed, but that was tricky in practice. I took a four -day course on mold making 
and then made three more -successful molds at home.  
 
These are the three plaster casts that emerged .

         141 
 
Here is my portrait of Giacometti. Behind it is the blue rubber cast with the jagged 
slit for removing the cast and the gray mother -mold that holds the flexible mold in 
place during the pouring of the liquid plaster.  
Many of Giacometti’s clay sculptures decayed and crumbled in his studio. His brother, 
Diego, made molds and plaster casts, which saved many sculptures. I can see how this was important , as several of my studies of Giacometti also broke , and the plaster casts 
were a way to preserve them.  Giacometti cast his clay sculptures in plaster and 
eventually in bronze for sale. He did not fire the clay because he usually worked on 
metal armatures to support the clay.  
I customarily  fire and sometimes glaze  my clay originals. I often paint the plaster casts 
to look gold  or bronze. Here are my casts of the Pregnant Mayan, Tony’s Torso  and my 
portrait of the artist. Other casts are shown in the section on Giacometti Studies and 
in the Catalog.

Above are two plaster c asts of my study of Giacometti ’s “Tall Figure, ” One is painted 
bronze. 
In addition to creating a bronze appearance with metallic paints, I tried “cold casting” 
my Portrait of Giacometti . This involves mixing powdered bronze metal into the top 
coat of the black epoxy used for casting.  
 
Other casts of my studies of Giacometti’s early cubist works follow:  his “Head ,” 
“Couple ,” “Torso” and “Head .”

Cold Casting in Bronze  
After a busy season with clay and plaster casts, I finished 2019 by returning to wood 
carving, completing A Bite of the Apple , Sea Goddess of the Cape , Hinged Forms  and Return 
of the Osprey . I then took a break from sculpture, including two months in Florida. I 
returned home in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic.  
Without access to a kiln, I decided to focus on cold casting bronze, as I had attempted 
with the bust of Giacometti. I had in mind reproducing two sets of my clay figures:  
• A historic series in honor of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims landing on 
Cape Cod, with the Nickerson coin, the mask of William Nickerson and the 
mask of Josiah Mayo.   
• A series of prehistoric women: Venus  from Tubingen , Venus of Willendorf , Venus 
Relief, Larger Cycladic Figure and Athena.  
I acquired some new casting materials from the closeout of Hiram’s studio. I made 
the molds using Rebound 25, a flexible rubber material. I made mother molds from 
Free form Air, to hold the molds during casting. I cast using SmoothCast Onyx Slow, 
a black plastic, mixing in 1/3-part bronze filings. To bring out the bronze sheen, I 
rubbed the castings with steel wool and sprayed on a transparent finish  or waxed 
them . I also used Smooth- On 325, a casting material I had used for the Portrait of 
Giacometti  and the first set of bronze coins and bronze masks.  
The coin molds and mask molds were simple one -piece open molds. I poured the 
liquid casting mixture into the mold and swished it around to cover the surface to an 
adequate depth. I mounted two sets of the coin inverse and reverse for display, as well 
as the masks of Nickerson and Mayo.  These were for display at the Mayo House and 
the Nickerson Homestead exhibitions. I also cast bronze copies for myself.

The historic series was more problematic. It turned out that the clay I had used for 
Venus of Willendorf and the Venus relief was incompatible  with the mold material, so 
they bound together and I had to discard the original sculpture along with its mold.  
The Venus  from Tubingen  casting did not work well; it came our covered with sticky 
black liquid from the casting mixture . I made round bases for the original and for the 
casting of the Venus  from Tubingen  using  Smoothcast Onyx Slow  casting mixture 
without bronze , to support them on their small legs .

to using Smooth- On 325 for these, mixing in the bronze powder. I was able to make

a dark bronze paint) and three with bronze mixed into Smooth- On 325.

Photography of Ceramics and Sculpture  
Sculpture is famously difficult to photograph. Of course, one problem is that you 
cannot capture much of a 3 -D form in a 2 -D medium. But in addition, the subtleties 
of the surface are tricky to reproduce. Lighting, shadow, highlights, etc. are important 
in bringing out the three -dimensionality, depth and surface texture  
With advice from photographer Brown  Bergen , I bought a camera with good control 
of depth of field (F -stop) and experimented by taking many of the photos in this 
book, especially for the pieces created in 20 19. I also bought a set of photography 
lights and backdrops. I set up a photography area in a dark part of the basement so I 
could control the lighting.  
One thing I tried to do was capture the depth of my attempts to “open up” the mass 
of my wood and ceramic sculptures.

4. Reflections:  Philosophy of 3-D 
Form  
“One must give value to one’s existence by behaving as if one's very existence were a work of art.”   
        – Fr. Nietzsche  
Thoughts on Organic F orm from N ature 
Prior to retirement, I occasionally carved wooden logs. I followed the lead of the log 
and of my tools, producing flowing curves that brought out the beauty and sensuality 
of the wood , as it had grown within a tree . I felt a kinship to the sculptures of Henry 
Moore and learned  about the abstraction of 3 -D form  from his masterpieces. As I 
became more involved in sculpture —including ceramics and plaster casts —I 
wondered increasingly about the role and nature of sculpture in today’s world, given 
the developmen ts in the field during my lifetime. This chapter presents  some of my 
reflections on that question.  
Historically, organic sculptural form was often associated with representation of the bodies of humans and animals. The invention of mechanical reproducibility with 
photography and video not only changed the aura of th ose work s (according to 
Benjamin), but also questioned the role of realistic likeness in sculpture. Modern 
European sculpture transitioned from realistic representation to more abstract study 
of 3-D forms in the oeuvres of Rodin, Brancusi, Degas, Giacometti, Moore, etc. That 
transition period in the history of sculpture by the generation or two before me has 
appealed to me more than subsequent developments, like metal constructions of 
geometric or industrial forms, experiments with high -tech materials , environmental 
happenings or pop- art plays on everyday artifacts.  
As this book documents, I have explored a delimited range of possibilities of 20
th and 
21st century sculpture. This included studies and reproductions of ancient sculptures, 
including the earliest known human  examples: Paleolithic, Cycladic, pre -Columbian 
and modern masterpieces. I took courses on realistic sculpture of the human body 
and used live models for portraits and torsos, to develop and understand the 
techniques involved  and to study the forms . The idea of “opening up” a log or lump 
of clay to crea te negative as well as positive forms and spaces is one specific direction 
that I have pursued.

         195 
The Working of a Work of Art 
Art— in contrast to objects of daily utility —functions to make our world visible, 
tangible and sensuous. It opens up the working  of the works of art. One wants to 
explore, touch, move around and contemplate pieces of sculpture in ways one rarely 
interacts with other objects . Everyday things are simply present for use in actions that 
are focused on implicit  goals;  we tacitly exploit  these objects as mere subservient 
means , paying little heed to their inherent qualities  and visual  appearance . 
Space is the Place 
Works of art draw attention to themselves, rather than to some other realm. They 
stand out in the everyday world by creating their own space. Space is an unobserved  
structure that is normally taken for granted or abstracted as a simple mathematical 
configuration  or empty volume . We move through space and glance through space 
without explicitly perceiving  the space itself. Every physical object takes up a space, 
which it defines by the volume within and around its surface. By displaying itself as a 
visual object, a sculpture can make visible the space it fills and the space it opens up 
around itself. It is even possible for a sculpture to be designed to open up spaces 
within the positive forms of the sculpture’s material, creating negative spaces , which can 
themselves become centers of focus .  
Making Reality Visible 
Objects from different realms have different forms. Sculptures can make these 
obtrusive and perceptible. Architecture  (which was originally inseparable from 
sculpture)  can both construct and reveal the spaces within which humans reside. Pop 
art makes the character of everyday, taken -for-granted commodities noticeable. 
Forms of the sea and sea life differ from those of the land ; sculpture can contrast 
these forms . Scale —which sculpture can play with —also makes a difference, bringing 
out details, relationships and spaces that are hidden on accustomed scale s. 
Mass Production 
Manufactured  objects today are commercial  commodities, explicitly designed for easy 
mass production by automated machinery , and mass produced with standardization 
for universal assembly. They have flat, 2 -D surfaces , following simpl istic 
mathematical shapes. They are efficient to fabricate  by machine and are 
interchangeable to facilitate  economical exchange on the global commodity market. 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         196 
They are derived forms of abstract value, not specific to any characteristics of origin, 
setting or intended application.  
Natural Evolution 
Organic forms, by contrast , evolve in response to their immediate environment. Their 
form follows from their uniquely situated function: a tree’s limbs bend to allow their 
leaves to capture sunlight in their particular setting , and a bird’s bones are shaped to 
provide strength and mobility with minimal weight and mass. Such conditions of growth result in flowing, but unique and complex  formations, with parts that support 
distinct functions  connected by transitional forms, which flow into each other, rather 
than simply butting up against each other and requiring connectors. An organism 
consists of an integrated formation  of multiple parts , with specialized forms merging  
into each other.  Organic sculpture can aim  to capture such structure in ways that 
display it to an observer’s senses.  
The Manufactured Environment  
In a philosophic passage, I once wrote that my sculptures are responses to the artificial character of the contemporary synthetic  environment. T oday’s  urban setting consists 
of plastic and concrete structures manufactured with homogenous materials and 
uniform geometric shapes, rather than with the organic forms of natur e. Technologies 
of manufacture have imposed these rigid, flat, symmetric shapes that are totally controlled by their makers  and machines. These shapes are simple and instantly 
understood by observers, so they fade into the background of assumed second nature , 
rather than provoking attention .  
In the twentieth century, several sculptors explored biomorphic abstraction , which 
features the subtle, flowing forms of biological nature in contrast to manufactured 
designs. These sculptures have always appealed to me and inspired my own efforts. 
Perhaps the biomorphic approach complemented the mathematical paradigm, which 
dominated my professional life in computer science.  
Organic Form 
My sculptures are not ahistorical ; not the result of some primordial experience of self -
consciousness interacting with unmediated nature. They are late -twentieth -century  
and early -twenty -first-century  explorations of form and material. In them, organic 
three -dimensional forms are showcased to contrast with socially prevalent two -
dimensional representations and with the basic geometric shapes produced by 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         197 
automated machinery. The inherent characteristics of the materials of nature are 
brought forth, in contrast to the artificial plastic substances that retreat from our 
consciousness in commodities. Furthermore , the usual pragmatic representational 
function of semiotic  objects is overcome  in the study of their abstracted physical 
forms and materiality. In negating  and surpassing  (Hegel: “ Aufhebung ”) the 
commonplace characteristics of signs —which point away from themselves —the non-
representational sculptures o btrusively confront their creator and viewers with the 
nature of the artifact itself as intentionally formed material object. Not representing 
some external subject, they point to themselves.  
Biomorphic Form and Cubism 
Biological organisms have evolved over eons to integrate multiple organs. Each organ 
has its distinctive function. The structure of the organism unites its constituent organs  
together in to a smooth functioning , creating a higher -level formation. Analogously, a 
complex sculpture can integrate multiple 3 -D forms, which complement or contrast 
with each other. Different faces of a particular mass can assume forms at tension with 
each other. A successful sculpture unifies its many sub-forms into a coherent 
struc ture. My wood sculptures tend to be biomorphic, often adopting 3 -D forms 
similar to biological organisms.  
Cubism tried to capture multiple visual perspectives on an object simultaneously. As 
works of 3 -D form, sculptures embody multiple perspectives when viewed from 
shifting angles. Cubism freed the arrangement of parts of a given object —such as 
organs within an organism or body —and sculpture can ad opt that freedom by 
displaying parts of a body selectively according to a unity of the sculpture that differs 
from that of its model —such as repositioning the features of a human face or body 
to highlight them indivi dually . The structure of the sculpture re presents selective 
aspects and arrangements of its model, while presenting  its own structural form , its 
re-integration of formal elements.  
A sculpture may integrate subparts at multiple levels. A complex form like Return of 
the Osprey may have numerous parts, each of which forms an organism of 3 -D forms 
flowing into each other. It may take a viewer some time and effort to explore the 
sculpture at different scales and viewing angles.  
Rodin’s dynamic human poses  and Degas’ dancers make visual and haptic the 
structural potentials of the human body, with its joints and musculature. They often 
exceed or exaggerate the possible poses, combining specific perspectives and 
consecutive views slightly out of time. There is a tension between the model and the 
sculpture, in which post -photographic realism extends what is possible in the literally 
represented original.

Rodin Working on Works 
In his evocative book on Rodin, Rilke emphasized the creation of “ works” as a driving 
force for Rodin. The ephemeral w ork on sculptures was often more important than 
the persistent sculptures that resulted. The resultant sculptures were always somehow 
considered inadequate  by Rodin ; the problems that had been pursued in them were 
not completely or satisfactorily solved; it was hard to say when a given piece was 
finished —except by noting if it had been signed in preparation  for sale. Rodin lived 
above all to engage in his sculptural work ing. 
Degas never exhibited or sold his sculptures, except for “The Little Dancer.” He did 
not cast them, but simply worked on them in his studio for their own sake , as 
explorations of the possibilities of sculpture and the potentials of human bodily movement through space. Similarly , Giacometti  was driven to work and re -work his 
pieces endlessly , searching to capture his vision, rather than to produce finished 
pieces. The important thing is the working that goes into the work, rather than the 
resultant object, w hich captures  and preserve s the working.  Rodin, Giacometti and 
Degas all liked to come back to old pieces and re -work them —undercutting the sense 
that works were ever final, that th ey were no longer subject to working.  
In my recent involvement in sculpture, m y days often revolve around an agenda of 
working on some current piece. The point is not so much to produce yet more  object s, 
since I am not selling or using the resultant products. The point is to engage in the 
work, explore a sculptural or technical problem, re -discover what some other sculptor 
found in creating something that inspired me. The working is more important than the work , which drives and results from the working . Often, I attempt to capture 
something ab out the working in the resultant work.  
Degas’s Dancers 
Sculpture  can display the structure of objects, rather than just their surface 
appearances and attributes. Degas’ dancers, balanced instantaneously on one leg, 
capture the ephemeral structure of a ballerina’s motion through space around a center 
of gravity. The placement of the ballerina’s feet and the twist of her torso reflect 
slightly different moments in time and thereby imply and capture motion, like the 
subtly superimposed feet of Degas’ galloping horses , caught impossibly in mid -air. 
Although Degas’ sculptures , like “Grand Arabesque ,” represent  the human  form 
realistically, they a re freed from traditional conventions to centrally incorporate space, 
void and motion by allusion. His fleshed- out female forms begin to act as structural 
indications of space, with limbs reaching out in every direction. Dance suggests the 
flux of time, in which Degas’ figures unfold from one study to the next in growing 
configurations of space and figure integrated. Degas thereby defi ned the transition 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         199 
from representation to structu re in the history of sculpture according to Charles 
Millard, Curator of the Hirshhorn  Museum , in his study of Degas . 
Giacometti’s Plaster Sculptures 
Giacometti’s emaciated plaster busts and human figures capture the core spatial 
existence of a man or woman. The irreducible residue of one of his female sculpture s 
reduces her entire reality to being seen, according to John Berger, who feels that 
Giacometti created his plaster figures during his lifetime , for himself, as observer or 
anticipator of his future absence, his death, his becoming unknowable after occupying 
an un -shareable reality. We now take the place of Giacometti in looking at the tall 
woman , in her structure as a solitary presence.  
Despite all the talk of Giacometti’s figures as representing existential alienation, his 
figures inevitably take up social and spatial positions in the shared world —with the 
many other plaster figures in his studio, with selected companions in exhibition 
collections and within spaces explicitly defined by their platforms, glass enclosures 
and metal cage outlines. Individual human forms are elements in composite material 
and social structures.   
The structure s of Giacometti’s constructions prominently include  spatial 
relationships, with the distances between plaster figures indicating social distances and 
their glances passing by and ignoring each other to accentuate the reduction to solitary 
individuals in communal settings. The spaces defined between figures , cages or 
platform edges create distance from the viewer, much as a painting’s chosen 
perspective does. Giacometti’s sculpture creates vacuum  (nothingness) , starting from 
mass or plenum  (bein g), according to Sartre —locating his friend’s work within the 
dialectical conceptualizations of Being and Nothingness . The radically reduced positive 
space of the sculpture  projects negative space all about it, stretching out to the viewer 
and distancing the figure as alone and un -reachable. 
I have been intrigued by the creation of space through configurations of matter and void. Lived, meaningful space is not a mathematical manifold or Newtonian 
coordinate system, extending uniformly everywhere, absolute and independent of 
content arbitrarily located within it. Rather, it is a felt openness to being, projected 
around specific materials in concrete formations. Space invites and envelopes  objects, 
flows around them, opens  opportunities for other shapes; it  penetrates into gaps 
through and betwee n the objects. The sculptural form opens up the space in which 
matter  appears and also in which it pointedly does not appear.  
In my attempts to open up masses, such as in my recent ceramic constructions  (see 
below  my “Thoughts on opening up spaces”),  I create  structures that define intricate 
positive and negative spaces without covering up the surface o r filling in the interior.  
One way to open up a space most effectively is to reduce the mass of the positive 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         200 
focal form to a minimum, as Giacometti did in his mature sculptures. For Giacometti, 
this approach corresponded to the character of human vision.  He said he struggled 
to capture what his eye actually perceive d, as opposed to what the mind constructs as 
a figure. Of course, his eye was uniquely trained by a lifetime of looking carefully at 
models. Moreover, what he referred to as the mind  that imposes meanings was its 
preconceptions and stereotypical images.  
Realistic Sculpture 
For a while, I work ed on realistic sculptures of live models and from photos of people, 
especially human faces, including my own. Working from a live model is invaluable 
training for seeing the structures of heads and bodies. Standard techniques  for 
creating masses and planes  are also helpful in roughing in the 3- D forms. However, 
the rote representation of a subject using established techniques for reproducing some 
supposedly objective view of the subject is not in itself  an artistic process. For 
instance, using pointing machines in the baroque era to produce copies of living 
bodies was useful for some processes, like making copies of a sculpture, but less for 
creating an original work of art.  
When we see somebody —not by staring at their facial image as at a photo— as part 
of interacting with them, we do not perceive a smooth manifold with standard features and manifold details. We see the person, the personality, perhaps as 
synthesized into  a vague mental  image of their general likeness  or attitude .  
Consequently,  a sculptural representation of the person should not be a 3 -D 
reproduction of their body, frozen at one instant. It should be something that projects 
their personality. That is the source of Rodin’s emotional movement, often distorting 
the surface in energized waves of vibration. Similarly, it is the person’s spatia l 
presence, at its essential core in Giacometti’s structures, which resist being confined to precise and smooth appearances. These sculptures may not look “realistic” in the 
photogr aphic sense, but the artists felt that they captured living reality in a sculptural 
way. 
The critic, Leo Steinberg, argued that realistic sculpture is important even after the invention of the camera, but not in a rote, technological sense. He claimed that “the 
eye is part of the mind,” that is , that  
“technical capacity in imitation implies what no one seriously believes: that nature confronts man with a fixed, invariant look. We know better than that. 
Appearances reach us through the eye, and the eye is part of the brain and 
therefore inextricably inv olved in mysterious cerebral operations. Thus, nature 
presents every generation (and every person who will use his eyes for more than 
nodding recognitions) with a unique and unrepeated facet of appearance…. And 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         201 
if appearances are thus unstable in the human eye, their representation in art is 
not a matter of mechanical reproduction, but of progressive revelation.”  
Works connected with discoveries of representation, purvey not given facts, but “the 
thrill and wonder of cognition. ” 
According to Steinberg, about half the great art generated by humanity —starting with 
Paleolithic art —is dedicated to the accurate transcription of the sensible world. 
However, artists do so in particular ways, rendering their subjects according to 
available technologies, cultures, conceptualizations, predecessors and the gleanings of their own work. Standardized techniques for capturing likeness miss the to -be-
interpreted character of the subject.  
A modern photo can instantaneously reproduce the physical appearance of a subject 
at a specific moment. However, for instance in the case of a face speaking or a body 
moving, the muscles involved (with their accompanying prominences and shadows) 
are contin uously shifting. The perceived appearance over a time segment posits the 
unity to these momentary stages. It is the interpreted unity that projects an underlying character or personality or motion or emotion to the subject. The challenge is to then 
represe nt in a 3 -D form the subject’s character through this unity —rather than simply 
a photo -like snapshot picture. If “realistic” means aiming for the snapshot, then 
sculpture needs to incorporate the techniques of realism without setting them as the 
ultimate  aim. The representational goal is, rather, to capture the personality that shines 
through the unity of the likeness.  
Tutorials on realistic sculpture rightly emphasize procedures of building up from 
skeleton to musculature to flesh (fat and skin). These are the layers that  conduct the 
body’s motion: the joints, the tendons and the masses. They are not static structures, but vibrant effectors of motion. As they shift and swirl, the body’s forms swell and 
ebb. Each individual’s figure is defined by its unique configuration of  bones, muscles, 
fat deposits and skin wrinkles. As a person breathes, speaks and moves, this unique  
complex cycles through its characteristic topologies. The sculptor struggles to capture 
this through his eye, mind, body, materials, skills, techniques and style.  
Eye and Mind 
For the philosopher Merleau -Ponty, human existence is fundamentally embodied. 
Visual perception is the primary mode of perception of the human body. Vision is 
intimately integrated with our tactile sense, so that “the visible world and the world 
of my motor projects are eac h total parts of the same Being ” (Eye and Mind ). 
Sculpture corresponds to this foundational unity of vision and touch. A sculpture 
leads the hand and eye across its surfaces, whether actually or in the perceiver’s 
imaginative projection . Unlike painting or even relief, the 3 -D forms lure perception 
around the facing façade and into the sculpture’s depth. Although only certain shifting 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         202 
surfaces are v isible at any given moment, the  different perspectives  possible from 
around the mass  flow into each other, evoking and leading eye and hand and mind.  
Sculpture explores the depth of objects in the world. While depth is merely implied 
in painting, through tricks of perspective and shading, for instance, it is  explicit in the 
massing of 3 -D forms.  The sub- forms of a sculpture reference each other by 
overlapping and concealing —only to then reveal as one circumnavigates the 
sculpture. As Merleau -Ponty puts it, “The enigma consists in the fact that I see things , 
each one in its place, precisely because they eclipse one another , and that they are 
rivals before  my sight precisely because each one is in its own place.”  As one 
successively perceives each facet, the previously seen  planes recede into hidden but 
remembered depths. Each angle on the sculpture reveals new, unanticipated forms 
and integrates them into a felt 3 -D whole, with depth in space.  
The sculpture’s flow of curves and obtrusive features forms a surface, creating a 
boundary between the surrounding transparent space and the opaque internal mass. 
Depending upon the material of the sculpture, one may wonder about the nature of 
the interior. For instance, the hidden grain within  a wood sculpture , its transition from 
outer to core wood,  residues of its  sticky amber sap, origins  of its former branches 
and other organic vestiges of its growth  may suggest mysterious  structures of potential 
interest. The hardness of stone may challenge one to desire a glimpse inside  and the 
homogeneity of clay might motivate an urge to break its impenetrability.  
The dynamic of the observer’s perception of a work has its correspondence in the 
prior production of the work by the sculptor. The sculptor undergoes similar 
perceptual processes, possibly more focused, even conscious  or reflective. The forms 
emerge in the work  as the sculptor may attempt to bring out,  structure and mold  the 
perceptual effects . The material offers unexpected features and the sculptor’s work 
responds by enhancing or removing selected features to create interesting forms and 
an over- all work,  with its effects of perceptual stimulation, motion, depth and space . 
The successive stages of sculpting define forms at different scales, which may be 
compatible with each other. The selection of a particular log or a bag of clay; the 
roughing in of the log o r the massing of clay; the construction of major forms or 
primary  structural elements; the defining of flowing or rough surfaces; the refining of 
forms and surfaces; the finishing of surfaces with oil, glaze, paint, embedded elements; the mounting of the finished piece; lighting; photography; display ; presentation . 
A sculptor who explores and learns about specific material forms  may try to render 
those discoveries visible and even dramatic in the work  as a being  in the world .

A Heideggerian View of Sculpture  
In his essay on “The Thing,” the philosopher of Being, Heidegger , considers  the 
example of a jug, as created by a potter on a wheel. He suggests  that the thingness of 
the jug is centered on its  interior void, which can be filled with water or wine and can 
offer it for pouring and imbibing. But he does not describe how the jug comes to be 
what it is  as a unique being.  
Learning to make pottery  involves acquiring skills and knowledge to be able to 
produce jugs and other ceramic works that more or less fulfill th e ability of a 
successful jug. This has many aspects; creating a jug (e.g., on a potter’s wheel) involves 
a series of phases: acquiring and preparing the clay, gathering the tools and equipment, 
centering the lump of clay on the rotating wheel, opening a void in the lump, pulling 
the sides up in several pulls without the sides collapsing, shaping the form  (with the 
interior curve corresponding to  the exterior curve), partially drying the piece to give 
it strength, trimming the thrown piece and cutting a foot on it, gently shaping  a spout 
that will pour without dripping, attaching a pulled length of clay for a handle that will 
fit a human grip and p rovide balanced lifting, slowly  drying the clay without cracking, 
optionally adding design to the surface, firing the jug, glazing it and firing it again.  
Each stage of producing the jug is an experiment and the final product is always 
somewhat of a surprise. One learns through years of practice how to control each 
phase and what one prefers as results of each stage. However, at most phases there is 
usually some interplay between one ’s aims and the results. Generally, when one sees 
the piece as it is uncovered during the drying or when it comes out of the kiln, one is confronted by an object with its own character, and one must take up what one finds 
as the s tarting point for the next phase. As Hegel said, the worker is alienated from 
his product as it becomes an independent object existing in the world. There are so 
many variables in the clay, the wheel speed, the drying conditions, the pressure of the 
hands, the chemical reactions of the glaze and the work of the potter that one can 
only approach an ideal of control where one can produce something like w hat one set 
out to make. Such control takes considerable experimentation and practice.  
Ceramic jugs are one of the oldest and most universal of human artifacts. Once humans around the world harnessed fire, they learned to make and “fire” (bake) useful 
and beautiful jugs. My study of pottery is part of my philosophic investigation of the 
nature of artifacts. 
In The Origin of the Work of Art , Heidegger writes:  
“Although it becomes actual only as the creative act is performed, and thus 
depends for its reality upon this act, the nature of creation is determined by the 
nature of the work…. To create is to cause something to emerge as a thing that 
has been brought forth. The work’s becoming a work is a way in which truth 
becomes and  happens. ”  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         204 
The craft of the artist involves  creating  a work  that opens up a world and reveals 
something  (as discussed in  my philosophy dissertation) . This craft requires a 
dialectical back and forth between the artist’s inquiring over time and the successive 
revelations  of the art works  produced.  The artist— akin to  a philosopher or scientist —
proceeds along  a journey of inquiry, gradually revealing new truth s through sequences 
of more -or-less insightful works. This is a historical process, in which the artist pushes 
his or her own previous inquiries further in specific directions, confronting issues that 
arose in past works and employing techniques that have been developed in previous 
inquiries , including by earlier artists . This involves mastering crafts, materials and 
technologies  of the past or of earlier  works . It involves posing specific problems to 
solve , and new directions to explore. 
In his discussion of a van Gogh painting, Heidegger generally misses its art -historical 
importance. He views the painting as purely representational of a peasant woman’s 
shoes. He misses the relationship to the impressionist revelations about light (and 
shadow) or van Gogh’s own exploration of brushstroke as an elem ent of the 
materiality of paint.  
The work involves a dynamic between revealing and concealing. As a work, a 
sculpture opens a special space around itself, structured by its 3 -D form, which 
reaches  out in that space. The surfaces of the form are revealed, but they 
simultaneously conceal what lies below , behind  or beyond the surface: the interior of 
the wood, stone or other material  and its hidden facets . This dynamic that takes place 
at the surface of a sculpture is Heidegger’s notion of the “ Riss,” which I always found 
to be the most obscu re concept in his essay on art. I did not fully realize how Riss 
entails  both the tearing conflict between un -concealing and re -concealing and also the 
design, outline or figure of the work, e.g., the surface form of a sculpture , which 
defines its shape while enclosing its interior  and indicating its hidden perspectives . 
Certain sculptures may attempt to open up th e concealed  interior— for instance by 
poking a hole into or through the surface forms , or by chipping away the smooth 
outer surface to expose internal material —and perhaps simultaneously to reveal the 
effort of carving the material by leaving traces of that human effort and procedure.  
Through such elements of the work’s design, the interior is opened up, but then 
simultaneously closed up along the new surfaces of the holes. 
Negative form can be viewed as an effort to reverse what is concealed and what is 
revealed. In some sculptures, I have tried to reveal the space itself by simply outlining 
it or otherwise indicating it. In others, I have tried to open up the normally conce aled 
interior space by providing just a structure to define it as a space, while leaving the 
interior— or at least the interior space —visible.  One could consider Giacometti’s thin 
plaster sculptures to be presenting just the interior of a figure, absent the  usual 
concealing layer of fat and skin.  (See my Study of Giacometti Tall Figure in contrast to 
my Chatham Sunbather  or Tony’s Torso.)   
Works of 3 -D Form  
         205 
In my Globe Structure Maquette , the work is almost reduced to its supporting structure.  
This opens up the surface of the globe that would have covered it, revealing not just 
the interior space, but also the structures of hidden sides. Although each individual 
perspective provides a different, unanticipated image of the work, it also reveals 
enough of the other sides  to show how they relate. In addition, in this work the 
negative spaces become as important as the positive forms, often seeming to support 
or at least define them.   
 
    
    
 
The inquiries into opening up that began with pocking a hole in a solid mass have 
here reached a point where the negative spaces open connections among the various 
surfaces. Both negative and positive spaces flow into each other in complex ways, which guide the observer’s hand, eye and mind around the structure.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         206 
The work of art is also a communication between the creator and the observer of the 
work, an attempt to guide the viewer/preserver to see what the creator has made 
visible in the work. As Heidegger notes  about viewing art, “Preserving the work does 
not reduce people to their private experiences, but … grounds being for and with one 
another as the historical standing -out of human existence in reference to un -
concealed -ness.” Thus, the work functions to build historically situated inter -
subjectivity , grounded in the work . 
 A work of sculpture brings some thing into the world, opening up a space for it to 
do its work  in its historical social setting.  It is interesting to consider how sculpture 
has worked in different periods of human creativity.

Pre-histor ic Sculpture 
Like every cultural tradition, sculpture is an on -going conversation across generations 
of practitioners. Art is considered a characteristically human mode of expression. 
Sculpture as 3 -D form takes its place along with 2- D drawing or painting, music, 
dance, and other art forms. Particularly since communication was established globally, artists in one part of the world have been influenced by exemplars  of art from other 
places and times. For instance, it is now possible to see paradigmatic samples of art 
from the primary stylistic epochs and principal world regions collected next to each 
other at major museums.  
I have been interested in prehistoric  and non -European sculpture, particularly during 
my travels to the countries where these were created. Sculptures from non -
technological cultures  are often quite abstract, in the sense that they abstract away 
from details and capture larger forms in a stylized way. This abstraction may be 
attributed to the limitations of the sculptural materials (bone, stone, clay) and tools 
(hand, sharpened rock) or to cultural traditions or to some innate human mode of 
observation, tho ught and expression. One can learn much from these works. I was 
astonished at the extent to which the oldest known sculpture of the human figure 
teaches you when you try to duplicate it  and was delighted by how the earliest Latin 
American  carvings do so as well.  
In my own sculptural attempts, I have often tried to follow the lead of historic (or 
pre-historic) examples. By mimicking their forms in my own way and in my own 
materials, I have been inspired and gained insight into 3 -D form s. 
The T übingen V enus 
The Venus of Hohle Fels is an Upper Paleolithic figurine dated to between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest undisputed examples of figurative 
prehistoric art.  This figurine of a voluptuous woman carved from mammoth ivory 
and excavated from a cave in southwestern Germany is the oldest known example of 
3-D or figurative representation of humans , and sheds new light on the origins of art.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         208 
 
Four views of the Venus of Hohle Fels. The figure is about 2 ½ inches tall  (slightly larger 
than the picture here ). 
The intricately carve d headless figure is at least 5, 000 years older than previous 
figurines and dates from shortly after the arrival of genetically modern humans in 
Europe. It exhibits many of the characteristics of fertility, or Venus, figurines ca rved 
millennia  later.  
It was found in southern Germany in the Danube valley, the migration corridor for 
modern Homo Sapiens into Europe. The figurine’s  site was successively and 
repeatedly home to both Neanderthals  and Homo S apiens . This raises the possibility 
that such figurative art arose through the confrontation or intermixing of these two 
humanoid species. There is no evidence of art in the culture of the Neanderthals, but 
also no art like this in the culture of Homo Sapiens until they left Africa and met the 
Neanderthals. It is now known that the two species met and even mated, although 
the nature of their relationship in general is controversial. The theory that Homo 
Sapiens  violently eradicated the Neanderthals is currently doubted.  The Neanderthals 
existed for much longer than H omo Sapiens has, survived the ice age and exhibited 
many skills.  Art always thrives in cultural mixing pots.  
The Venus of Hohle Fels shows a range of entirely unique features as well as several 
characteristics  present in later female figur es. The Venus lacks a head. Instead , an off -
centered, but carefully carved ring is located above the broad shoulders of the figurine. This ring, despite being weathered, preserves polish suggesting that the figurine was 
worn as a pendant. Beneath the shoulders, which are roughly as thick as they are wide, 
large breasts project forward. The figurine has two short arms with two car efully 
carved hands with visible fingers resting on the upper part of the stomach below the 
breasts. 
The Venus has a short and squat form with a waist that is slightly narrower than the 
broad shoulders and wide hips. Multiple deeply incised horizontal lines cover the 
abdomen from the area below the breast to the pubic triangle. Several of these 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         209 
horizontal lines extend to the back of the figurine and are suggestive of clothing or a 
wrap of some sort. Microscopic images show that these incisions were created by 
repeatedly cutting along the same lines with sharp stone tools. The legs of the Venus 
are short and pointy. The breasts, buttocks and genitals are exaggerated and depicted 
in more detail. In addition to the many carefully modelled  anatomical features, the 
surface of the Venus preserves numerous lines and deliberate markings.  
Many of the features, including the emphasis on sexual attributes and lack of emphasis 
on the head, face and arms and legs, call to mind aspects of the numerous Venus 
figurines well known from the European Gravettien, which typically date between 
22,000 and 27, 000 years ago. The careful depiction of the hands is reminiscent of 
those of Venuses including that of the archetypal Venus of Willendorf, which was 
discovered in 1908. Despite the far greater age of the Venus of Hohle Fels, many of 
its attributes occur in various forms throughout the rich tradition of Paleolithic female representations. 
The figure, about 2.4 inches tall, was carved from a mammoth tusk.  The intricate 
detailing achieved with primitive stone tools indicates the amount of energy invest ed 
in these little objects— tens if not hundreds of hours.  
I viewed the origin al carving on my last trip to Tü bingen and was given a scale replica 
of it. I decided to create a larger version to see the sculptural forms of the carving 
more clearly, abstracting from the intentional scratching of the surface as well as the 
cracks from assembling the many pieces of th e original find.  
As I worked on the piece, I was impressed at the elegant abstraction of the human 
female form as well as its capture of the maternal stance of the pregnant woman. Early 
humans  during the Ice Age clearly had perception, empathy, concern and 
craftsmanship  that would rival that of contemporary people.

In September and November 2017, I carved a set of two sculptures in cherry wood, 
based on an ancient stone sculpture from Ecuador.

Friends  had commissioned me to make a sculpture for them and I thought for some 
time about doing a sculpture of a bird, since they loved birds, particularly owls. One 
day, browsing through pictures I had taken of pre -Columbian sculptures in a museum 
in Ecuador in  2013, I came upon my favorite of the collection and started to research 
it on the Web.  
Here is the photo I took —as well as a collection of other Valdivian stone sculptures : 
    
This carving is one of the earliest known sculptures in the Americas, a Valdivian stone 
carving from Ecuador. Valdivian stone figures are rectangular in shape with delineated 
eyes and features in characteristic minimalist style.  
The Valdivia Culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula 
near the modern -day town of Valdivia, Ecuador, between 3500 BC and 1800 BC.  
First, I carved a sculpture based on the Valdivian owl for my friends. I liked it so 
much, I made another one for my own collection, perched on a branch.  
The Cycladic Figure 
In 2015, I carved a sculpture based on early ancient Greek Cycladic sculpture. The 
wood is English Plane (related to sycamore) from a large tree we had taken down in 
our back yard a couple of years earlier . It was one of several logs that I had the arborist 
cut from the tree before removing the rest by crane. I started carving the log, based 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         212 
on a small copy of a Cycladic sculpture that I had purchased in Greece. During two 
visits, Rusty  assisted in the carving.  
Because my sculpture is based on the Greek marble Cycladic sculptures from the birth of Western sculpture and because of their connection with fertility, I named my 
sculpture “Baby” and dedicated it to Rusty and Sarah's daughter, my second 
granddaughter , Ruby, upon her birth.  
It was at first difficult to achieve the three -dimensional symmetrical form of the 
model. In addition, the quality of the wood see med ragged, so I wondered if I w ould 
be able to get a nice surface or reveal an interesting grain. It was not until the piece 
was completed and oiled that the beauty of the wood was revealed.  
   
The original Cycladic sculptures date back to the Neolithic era of pre -history, between 
5000 BCE and 2400 BCE. They were carved in the finest Greek marble, which is local 
to the Cycladic islands and was later exported to Athens and elsewhere in classical 
Greek times. Little is known about the Cycladic people and their world, although the 
group of islands was a crossroads of the Mediterranean even before sailing ships were 
invented.  
The Cycladic sculptures were likely fertility objects. Most of them represented young 
women of childbearing  age and accentuated their female features. Certainly, they 
involved the life cycle, and are often found in graves.

         213 
   
The Cycladic sculptures all possess certain features: canonical (e.g., folded arms), 
proportional and simplistic. They appear in museums now as pure in their whiteness. 
However, these sculptures were frequently painted. Pigments were used to add detail. 
The only facial feature carved was the nose. The sculptures have all been excavated at 
Cycladic cemeteries.  
The Neolithic and Bronze Age Cycladic figures present an intriguing link between 
prehistoric art and Western art; between the figurines of Galgenburg and Willendorf 
and the sculptures of Brancusi and Modigliani. As Lord Colin Renfrew states of these 
sculptures , “a handsome standing figure, with quiet, unassertive rhythms and balanced 
proportions, achieves one of the most compelling early statements of the human 
form. ”  
 
Is it that there is something incredibly modern about these prehistoric figurine  
sculptures, or has humankind always portrayed the human form in a manner that 
utilizes elegance and simplicity, with figures mastered by style and yet full of life? The 
emotional pitch is achieved by the omissions, distortions and exaggerati ons, and in so 
doing the artist  creates  a tension between the abstract and the real.  
The Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens —a favorite of mine —is dedicated to the 
study and promotion of ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, with special emphasis on Cycladic Art of the fifth millennium BC. It was founded in 1986. Its 
collection is one of the finest collections of Cycladic artifacts in the world.

The Cycladic Islands of Greece are set in the Aegean Sea. The ancient Greeks called 
these islands the Kyklades, a scattered kyklos or circle, of islands around the holy island 
and sanctuary of Apollo: Delos. The Cyclades had rich mineral deposits  and fine 
marble . They were close to each other, which made safe navigation between the 
islands in rowboats easy (sailing ships were only invented ca. 2000 BC). During the 
Early Bronze Age, when people started using bronze for their tools and weapons, a 
sophisticate d culture flourished in the Cyclades that thrived for almost a millennium. 
This period —called Early Cycladic —ranges from 3200 to 2000 BC.  
The Early Bronze Age inhabitants of the Cyclades used their local supplies of premier 
white marble to make both figurines and a variety of stone vases. The development 
of sculpture was one of the most impressive achievements of the Early Cycladic 
culture , no doubt made possible by marble and bronze technolog ies. Archaeologists 
organize the well -known stylized marble figurines in two basic types: schematic and 
naturalistic. The majority of Cycladic figurines represent nude females in standing 
position. Less frequent are models of male musicians, warriors and grou ps of figures 
in a range of postures.  
I took these photos at the Museum during May 2010, when we went on a wonderful  
cruise of the Cycladic Islands to celebrate my 65th birthday:

Pre-Columbian Sculpture  
I have always loved pre -Columbian sculptures and figures —at least since my family 
trip to Mexico when I was 1 7. The Olmec, Maya, Inca  and Aztec cultures all had 
wonderful pottery, masks and carvings.  
The ancient Olmec culture specialized in large stone carvings, which are relatively 
rare. I saw some near Vera Cruz on my honeymoon in 1989 and more during a trip 
to Guatemala in 2014 . The Mayans, Incans and Aztecs  had their pyramid temples with 
relief carvings , stone carvings and pottery incorporating striking images of gods and 
animals.  
Over a dozen Mayan and Aztec sculptures named Chacmool  have been found , dating 
from 800 AD on. The distinctive posture of the Chacmool is what allows the many 
sculptures to be united under one term: the figure reclines on his back, his knees bent 
and his body on a single axis from neck to toes. The elbows rest on the ground and 
support the torso, creating tension as the figure strains to  sit upright. The hands meet 
at the chest, usually holding either a disk  or a vessel, possibly for human sacrificial 
hearts . The head rotates ninety degrees from the axis of the body to present a frontal 
face. This recumbent position represents the antithesis of aggression: it is helpless and 
almost defenseless, humble and acquiescent .

Modern Sculpture  
Brancusi Simplicity 
Constantin  Brancusi (1876 -1957) is the modern ist sculptor who reduced forms to 
their simplest essence. Born in Romania (where my paternal grandparents came from), 
Brancusi was active in Paris during the blossoming of abstract art, partially inspired 
by exotic sculpture of prehistoric and non -European cultures. 
Throughout my life, I often visited the room in the Philadelphia Museum of Art 
dedicated to Brancusi’s sculptures. I also lingered in Brancusi’s studio, recreated in 
Paris. In particular, I loved the purity and sophistication of Brancusi’s “ Bird in Flight” 
sculpture, which he produced in several media.  
             
Brancusi’s marble sculpture in his atelier, my oak sculpture in Rusty’s living room . 
To reawaken my sculpting after several years of non -use, I challenged myself to 
reproduce “ Bird in Flight” in wood, using a curved white oak limb from a tree in my 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         218 
Philadelphia woodland. I later decided to do a larger version for outside my house in 
Chatham, from a wild cherry limb from my woodlands there.  When I thought about 
teaching a class in ceramic sculpture, I tried modeling Brancusi’s  “Bird in Space ” in 
clay. 
           
Moore Forms 
Henry Moore (1898 -1986) has always been my primary inspiration in sculpture. His 
sculptures have allowed me to see and feel 3 -D form s. 
I have looked carefully at Moore’s sculptures whenever I came across them and have 
run my hands as well as my eyes over their surfaces, textures, curves and edges. I have 
read many books about his sculpture, which mainly involves looking at the pictures , 
which try to capture the 3 -D sculptures in 2 -D photos.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         219 
 
Moore went beyond Brancusi by adding back some of the complexity of organic 3 -D 
forms, while retaining the clarity of the simple underlying forms. 
Moore was one of the pioneers of direct carving (as opposed to the academy’s use of 
pointing tools to mechanically copy models). He was also one of the first sculptors to 
explore holes or negative spaces in sculpture —whether leaving open space between 
forms or actually poking holes in solid masses.  
I have always adopted direct carving and been interested in negative space. I am 
exploring how to go beyond Moore’s holes to open up masses even more, using 
intersecting negative spaces and defining negative spaces with partially surrounding 
positive forms . 
I was long intrigued by a maquette of Moore’s with two holes that looked like eyes in a face. I only knew it from a small photo from one view of it. When I created a ceramic 
sculpture (Eyes Opened Up ) to explore how his piece worked in 3 -D, I ended opening 
up the top to get behind the eyes and then opening up much of the lower body to replace a solid form supporting the piece with a set of structural forms creating a more 
complex negative space below the face. I conceived this as transforming Moore’s 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         220 
“pocking simple holes” into outlining and defining negative spaces by opening up 
larger forms. 
Although Moore was primarily a stone carver, he did a number of wood sculptures. 
My approach to wood carving is quite similar to Moore’s —although of course not at 
his level of artistry and professionalism. Once established, Moore was also able to 
work at a much larger scale  than I can.  
Moore combined 3-D forms in various ways. Sometimes forms were combined to 
resemble human or animal organisms (i.e., structures consisting of multiple organs or 
functional forms). Some of his sculptures were large blocks with decorative or 
symbolic forms in relief on them. In other sculptures, massive forms were joined to 
each other by bone -like connectors. Eventually, Moore assembled forms that leaned 
on one another or stood in relation to each other— whether the forms were actually 
attached  or not.  
In some of my sculptures from 2020 -2022, I combine forms that are or appear to be 
from separate masses (e.g., different logs). In 3-Tiered Structure , for instance, forms 
carved in three different logs are stacked to create a complex of positive and negative 
forms. Perhaps this moves even further from Brancusi’s focus on individual forms 
than Moore moved in his pieces  with multiple interrelated forms.  In addition, my 
structures are studies of the “topology” (see below)  of the connections forming the 
positive  and negative spaces.  
Studies of Giacometti 
Sculptors generally make copies of works by their predecessors. Sometimes the goal 
is to reproduce the original faithfully, to some degree. Other times one adapts a pose 
or technique to a different subject. One can learn enormously by copying the masters. 
In previous times, students of sculpture learned through apprenticing an experienced 
artisan, working under their direction and being trained in their ways of seeing, 
planning, creating, reproducing and marketing sculpture. Copying interesting works 
is a w ay for students today to learn from a variety of experts, who are not personally 
available.  
In Spring 2019 after returning from a stay in Florida away from my studio, I re -
engaged in sculpting by studying the life and work of Giacometti . I read James Lord’s 
lengthy biography and looked at books of photos of his sculptures, which were mainly 
modeled  in clay or wax  and cast in plaster.  
Works of 3 -D Form  
         221 
 
In quick succession, I copied several of Giacometti’s sculptures that appealed to me  
(see the section above on my “Giacometti Studies Series .” Most were from his early 
cubist period. I created each piece in clay and then made a rubber mold and cast it in 
plaster. I also fired the original clay version when possible.  
On the way to Florida, I had seen all Degas’ sculptures in the National Gallery in DC. 
So, I did a clay study of his Little Dancer , the only sculpture he displayed during his 
lifetime.

Topology of 3 -D Form  
“Topology” is the logos of topoi, which is Greek for the logical structure or study of 
places, which are spaces defined by materials, such as the surfaces of 3 -D objects. 
There is a field of mathematics devoted to formalizing topology. Euclid had already 
studied regular 3 -D polyhedrons, such as the cone, pyramid, globe and the five 
Platonic solids.  
 
The five Platonic solids.  
For modern topology, these are all topologically identical in that they have a continuous surface separating an inside from an outside. A donut shape, for instance, 
is different, because its surface could not be stretched to form one of the Platonic 
solids  without somehow tearing the surface. I do not find the regular solids very 
interesting sculpturally, except perhaps as bases for stretching into twisted and 
asymmetric forms.  
A simple topological trick is represented by the Möbius Strip sculpture. A Möbius strip 
is a 2 -D band that has its two ends attached following a half twist. A simple band—
either lying flat or with ends attached without the twist —has two sides: a top and 
bottom or inside and outside. However, with the twist, it only has one side! If you  run 
your finger along one side, you end up on what looks like the other side before 
returning to where you started.   
A more obscure trick is represented by the Klein Bottle sculpture. A Klein bottle is a 
bottle shape whose neck is elongated, enters the jar through some fourth dimension, 
passes through the bottle and then flares out to form the body of the bottle. If you 
start at some point on what appears to be the inside su rface of the bottle and move 
along that surface and out the neck, you can come around to what appears to be the 
outside surface of the bottle. Of course, the 3 -D representation of a 4 -D Klein bottle 
requires some artistic liberty.

         223 
 
      
A Möbius strip and a Klein bottle  
Sculpture in the real world is neither 2 -D nor 4 -D, but has an inside (the wood or 
clay) and an outside (the oiled or glazed surface). However, if the sculpture has been 
opened up with negative spaces or surrounded holes, it can have different topological 
structures. For instance, some of my sculptures have zero, one, two or more holes —
making their topological structures mutually incommensurable. Furthermore, sculptures like Mrs. Mayo  and Three -Tiered Structure  have holes that interconnect, 
forming relative ly complex topologies. 
Sculpture, as the working of physical materials in the world, is conditioned by 
structural needs for strength and balance in order to persist and be displayed. The act 
of opening up a piece with significant holes must take these needs into account.  
It is interesting that the Angel of Progress  sculpture, as it winds up from its base, 
maintains two vertical supports at each of three stages. The two vertical supports flow 
out of the horizontal stage below and into the horizontal stage above. At each level, 
the two verticals and two horizontals fo rm a circle framing the hole that is opened up 
there. The three topologically distinct openings are located at angles above each other, together defining an imaginary vertical negative space where the core of the  log had 
been. Maintaining a pair of supports at each stage provides for strength and balance of the overall sculpture, which is delicately balanced and which takes advantage of the 
strength of the log’s vertical fibers. If any one of these verticals were removed, the 
weight of the upper part of the sculpture would produce a destabilizing torque, threatening breakage or collapse.  
The Pod sculpture, by comparison, has three verticals at each stage  (not clearly visible 
in any one 2 -D photo) , providing a considerably more stable structure. The Pod 
features three faces working collaboratively. The support for these faces spirals down 
through various forms, consolidating in three columns from the upper half of the 
sculpture that sit atop three columns from the bottom half. The bottom rests again 
on three legs. Maintaining a trio of support at each vertical level provides for 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         224 
substantial stability, avoiding the careful maintenance of balance needed in the Angel 
of Progress . This allows the Pod to support heavier, more massive forms.  
      
     
Details of Pod illustrating tripod support structure and geometric elements.  
The Three -Tiered Structure moves from five supports at the floor, to four 
connections between Tier #1 and Tier #2, to three connections between Tier #2 and 
Tier #3, to a single arch at the top rising from its two  legs. A variety of openings are 
formed by these supports and the forms they flow into. 
In a contrasting approach, the Hickory Bivalve  is balanced on a small central base. This 
sculptural trick makes the sculpture seem to float without support. This requires a 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         225 
strong hidden bolt anchoring the sculpture to a broad base. Similarly, Saddle Curve  is 
balanced on a single narrow support. However, in this case the sculpture was designed 
with a strong sense of internal balance. The sculpture has no separate base, but stands 
on a broad, three- toed foot that is integral to the design. The support sectio n is a 
sculptural curve, a twisting 3 -D parabolic form. The surface of the top -heavy upper 
part is a saddle curve, a topologically significant 2 -D manifold . The saddle point —
near the center of the log’s grain pattern —is a local high point in one direction and a 
low point in the perpendicular direction, like a horse -riding saddle that slopes up in 
the front and back of the rider and slopes down on the sides under the legs. In calculus terms, a saddle point is simultaneously a rela tive maximum and minimum. In the 
sculpture, this surface is used to display the visually interesting grain that evolved at 
the base of the cherry tree, just above root ground level. To accomplish this,  the log 
was flipped wide side up, requiring a supporting form that would provide adequate 
stability.

saddle curve of Saddle Curve .  
Sculptures with more complex topological structures may include interconnected 
openings. An early attempt at this was my Hermaphrodite. It has two vertical supports 
forming an elongated opening, which are then connected to an opening from above. 
Bite of the Apple  adds another opening, so that holes from four of the six perpendicular 
axes meet in the thereby opened up center of the piece. Similarly, Return of the Osprey  
has four openings that join in the middle of the log. Sly Eye has two openings defining 
the spiraling middle area of the rear of the piece entering into a cavernous opening of 
the wood’s mass from the front. Mrs. Mayo  features a more involved set of openings, 
including some largely hidden holes down the center, linking multiple openings. The inside/outside relations of Hinged Forms  are rather ambiguous, depending on whether 
the hinge is open or not; they can be seen as reducing the wood almost to an outline structure defining connected negative spaces, most notably the center of the log, for 
which opening the hinge provides easy access for the carving and the observation.  
The view of sculptural material as structures defining negative forms comes from my ceramic models and sculptures. See the section on my Negative Structures Series, 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         226 
featuring the following: Slab Sculpture 1, Slab Sculpture 2, Slab Sculpture 3, Sculpture with 
Grog and Negative Structure.  Here, the interconnected openings are too involved to 
easily count or describe. The approach shifts from opening up a solid mass to creating 
open space s by defining their boundaries.  
At the end of 2021, I returned to sculpting after taking a break to complete some 
publications. I decided to extend my topological exploration of sculptural structures 
with a three -tiered wood sculpture. I began with a series  of clay maquettes to get a 
feel for appropriate 3-D forms and connecting structures. I explored possible 
structures in clay for a couple of months. I then carved three logs from a large local 
pine tree that had been knocked down a few years earlier by a hurricane. The final 
structure r ises through 4, 3, 2 and then 1 upright structures. A number of distinct 3 -
D forms are connected by a network of structures and negative spaces.  The wooden 
forms differ from the clay forms, but incorporate structural understandings that I 
gained from the ceramic maquettes.  
Working in clay —such as the maquettes —involves different gravitational— and 
hence topological —considerations than carving wood. The clay must  hold its own 
weight as it dries and is fired, as well as balance properly as a finished piece. Clay 
structures are built up, whereas wood is carved away. So extreme opening up of 
negative spaces by reducing positive forms to a minimum involves adding clay  until 
it is strong enough versus removing wood without making it too fragile to withstand 
checking during drying or breaking under stress. Ceramic sculptures can be built up 
from spans of clay coils or elongated slabs, whereas wood sculptures are carved o ut 
from solid logs. Although the results are often quite different, I often create ceramic 
models that I can hold in my hand, easily view in 3 -D and quickly refine their masses, 
openings or connections. Such maquettes then inspire and guide the creation of  wood 
sculptures requiring a hundred  times as much time and effort. In this way, topological 
insights from one medium influence work in the other material. This is an important aspect of the dialectic between material and manipulation in sculpture.  
Sculptural topology —the structural logic of 3 -D form in matter like clay or wood —
contrasts with mathematical topology or geometry, although there are linkages between them. For instance, Pod and Saddle  Curve  incorporate lines, circles, triangles 
and curves, incorporating them however in masses that flow into one another in 
organic rather than mechanical or stylized ways. Mathematical and industrial figures 
are abstractions from physical objects; sculpture makes visible what is lost in such 
abstraction.

5. Space: Opening Up 3-D Form 
As discussed in the following chapter  on my sculpting techniques —as well as in the 
section on “Negative S tructures  Series” in the second chapter , above —a frequent  goal 
of my carving or modeling is to open up the material. The aim may be partially to 
supply  views into the heart of the mass —revealing swirling grains in heartwood, for 
instance. It may also offer a view of the internal structure, such as supports in clay or 
plaster pieces. Furthermore, it adds considerable complexity, asymmetry and 
formation to  the sculpture. Thereby, it suggests and invites more ways to observe the 
piece visually and tactually.

However, the primary effect of opening up a mass is on the space of the piece: the space around the piece and the spaces within the piece:  
Space is the place  
in which sculpture opens up.

In sculpture, the term “negative space” is often used to specify how a hole in a 
sculptural mass can be viewed as itself having a form —the negation of the form of 
the mass. Wittgenstein illustrated the phenomenon of “seeing as” either positive or 
negative spaces in simple drawings:  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         229 
 
Faces/vase drawing. The white positive space of the vase creates a black negative space of 
two faces looking at each other. By shifting v isual focus, you can see it in either one way or 
the other. 
In a sculpture, one can simply poke a hole, opening the mass with a negative space, 
or one can fashion the opening as an interesting interior form. The inner negative 
space can be integrated with the surrounding exterior negative space, so that the 
positiv e space of the sculpture’s surface flows from its outside into its interior.  
 
Holes . Red clay and paint. 2017. Based on a stone sculpture by Barbara Heppenworth, a 
contemporary of Henry Moore. This was a simple attempt by me   at creating  several holes 
in a cylindrical form and letting their spaces merge inside.  
Moore, Heppenworth  and others started by poking holes and then enlarging them 
into negative forms. I sometimes try to take this further, so that the positive and 
negative forms become equally important aspects of the sculpture. One can then view 
the sculpture as consisting primarily of open spaces defined by positive forms. The 
forms of the spaces then become paramount. For instance, there can by multiple open 
forms, flowing into each other, partially contained by positive forms.

The concern with opening up sculpture has evolved during my years sculpting. My 
first wood sculpture, Gelassenheit , did not open the original log at all, but let it be, and 
followed the lines of the log, simply defining interesting flowing contours that brought out the colorful grain of the black walnut. The next one, Twisted Sister, defined a 
negative space between i ts spiraling legs. Two natural holes from knots in the wood 
provided negative spaces like eyes.  
Then I did a plaster sculpture that was quite open, structured by chicken wire framing 
holding the plaster, which was soaked on rags. This piece not only had two short legs 
with space between them, but many openings that flowed from the exterior into the 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         231 
interior. The inside was structured with ropes to add interest to the inside, like nerves 
within a body  or brain. The openings from the outside merged into this complex 
internal space.

Some 15 years later, I carved the Owl of Minerva. Again, it had two shapely legs defining 
a 3-D negative space that twisted between them. It also had an open form that defined 
the owl’s wooden beak and poked through the back of the head to suggest an eye.   
    
Below, where I discuss how I carve the Open Cherry Trunk and Upright Cherry Figure , 
one can see the process of gradually opening up a log to create a unity of positive and 
negative spaces.

My most open wood sculpture is Mrs. Mayo . I discuss in the following chapter that I 
purchased new tools and developed a new approach to carve this sculpture. The 
Hickory Bivalve , which preceded this carving, was also opened up extensively. In 
particular, the openings in Mrs. Mayo  interweave and permeate the piece. The positive

forms that remain can be “seen as” largely containment structures that define the 
boundary between interior and exterior spaces.

In modeling with clay, one can build up structures, as opposed to carving out openings 
in solid material. This can provide more flexibility and access to explore the formation 
of negative spaces. My first attempts at this were Slab Sculpture 1 , Slab Sculpture 2 , Slab 
Structure 3, Sculpture with Grog and Negative Structur e.

These abstract ceramic explorations influenced my subsequent wood sculptures. I 
first modeled quick clay maquettes to try out approaches in 3 -D to opening up the 
logs. Following are some of these studies:

A special approach to opening up space used the Klein Bottle from topological 
mathematics. It is a 4- D closed manifold that has no differentiation of interior and 
exterior. I created a 3 -D representation using clay coils.  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         246 
 
There are some auxiliary windows to allow one to look inside, but they do not belong 
to the Klein Bottle. The large round hole facing dow n in the front is the opening of 
the tube that comes out the top, circles around, enters the main bottle at the back and then opens out the front. (The way the tube enters at the back is topologically illegal 
in 3-D, but takes artist’s license to account for only being able to create 3 -D forms in 
this world.) If you start from a point “inside” the bottle, you can proceed up the tube, 
around and out the front into the “outside” without crossing any surface, so that 
inside and outside are the same continuous space .  
The trick in opening up the inside this way is that the tube actually does penetrate the 
surface of the bottle in the back. In 4 -D it could enter without breaking the surface, 
in analogy with the Mobius Strip, which is a 2- D manifold that only has one surf ace 
in 3-D space. (See my ceramic Mobius Strip .)

6. Pr actice:  Sculpting 3-D Form in 
Wood  
Tools and Techniques  
I generally start with a log and a challenge. The two go together. For instance, if my 
challenge is to create a wooden sculpture that recreates some of the form of Brancusi’s 
Bird in Flight , then I need a log or branch that is long, thin and curved at one point. 
Perhaps the log comes first and suggests the challenge. Alternatively, t he log may 
contain the shape of a human head or a body with two or four legs.  
I like to create large sculptures  (almost on the scale of the human body) , so one can 
see and feel the forms easily. For practical purposes , I am limited to logs that are small 
enough and light enough for me to move around, perhaps with a hand truck, a lever 
or a friend.  
From my first wood sculpture to my last, I have used the  same tools to shape the 
form —literally the same physical large gouge and mallet. The gouge chips away 
chunks of wood about one square inch across and curved below. Hundreds of these 
gouge cuts provide the rough surfaces of the sculpture. I then use a foot -long 
Sureform rasp to smooth out the gouge marks and to create my characteristic long 
flowing curves. Typically, one form on the sculpture flows into another along curves 
refined by this rasp. Each o f the major forms in the sculpture is asymmetric, looking 
unexpectedly different from each angle of observation.  
If one looks at a sculpture as it is literally “taking shape” as an organism (an 
assemblage of multiple organ -like 3 -D forms), then the question arises of how to join 
the distinct forms together. This question is partially answered in the technical process  
of refining and smoothing the individual forms and the transitions between them. The 
rasp helps to define smoothly flowing, minimalist transitions between them like those 
found in bones and animal bodies.

         248 
   
My original mallet, gouge and rasp. Hand carving tools, including rifflers.  
Once the sculpture is well defined by the gouge and the rasp, the surfaces are refined 
to feel silky smooth to the touch, almost like skin. This is accompl ished with smaller 
rasps or riff lers—to get into the tight spots where the Sureform cannot reach —and 
by sandpaper. I typically use 4 or 5 successive grades of sandpaper, from very rough  
50-grade to super smooth 300 -grade wet -and dry. The final sanding is interspersed 
with oiling.  
I have always finished my sculptures with Tung oil. I used to mix my own Tung oil 
and boiled linseed oil, but now I use a commercial Wetlox blend, which works well  
for all wood surfaces . I give the sculpture at least three or four coats of oil, rubbed 
with the wet sandpaper. Sometimes, a sculpture can use another coat of oil after a 
year. 
 
My electric tools: chains aw, drill, belt sander and rout er. 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         249 
Gradually, I have begun to use electric tools to rough in and help shape the logs. For 
instance, in creating Mrs. Mayo , I wanted to open up the log and have interconnected 
opening s going throughout the scul pture. First, I created clay ma quettes or models of 
the log with various openings. In particular, my challenge was to rough in the 
sculpture with a chain saw, which can only cut long, straight cuts. I bought a chain 
saw that would be safe for sculpting. I also got a strong hand drill wi th large bits for 
drilling long or wide holes.  
   
Model s of Mrs. Mayo , featuring openings for chainsaw cuts. Holes drilled in base and leg of 
Mrs. Mayo  sculpture.  
A technical reason for wanting to open up the whole structure of Mrs. Mayo  was that 
the wood was still green, as the tree had just been felled. I started carving  right away, 
rather than waiting five to ten years for the wood to gradually dry from the inside out. 
Opening the log up so that no part was more than three or four inches thick reduced 
the chances of the wood splitting or checking as it dried and shrank f rom the outside. 
Although there was some checking while I carved the piece, it stopped as soon as I 
oiled it to seal the outside. Thus, the opening up process combined aesthetic, technical 
and practical issues of form, tools and materials.

Holes drilled for eyes. Hole (see light circle in center) drilled from middle of sculpture down 
to legs. 
Now I work in a studio  in my basement  that combines a carpentry workshop with a 
wood sculpture studio and a clay studio. As the need arises, I clear out an area to make 
a workspace for wood, clay, plaster, molds or photography.  
For many years, I have used a jigsaw, a belt sander and a router for creating sculpture 
bases and for doing some of the smoothing work on sculptures. Now, I can fluidly 
combine tools and techniques from carpentry, sculpture and ceramics.  
   
The ceramic and carpentry sections of my workshop . 
I often create small clay models of sculptures I have in mind. This is extraordinarily 
useful in getting a feel for the 3 -D forms, which are impossible to imagine in one ’s 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         251 
mind and to understand how the different perspectives fit together.  The human mind 
is shockingly weak at understanding 3 -D forms. Imagining complex sculptures 
without a good model is wickedly difficult, even with perspectival sketches or photos.  
For instance, I wanted to carve a log I had cut down specifically with a favorite wood 
sculpture by Moore in mind. I had several photos of the sculpture; even an entire 
book devoted to Moore’s process of creating that particular sculpture. However, I 
found it impossible to plan my carving until I made a rough plasticine clay model. Then I decided to make a larger, more accurate clay model using sculpting clay.  
 
Study of Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure: Holes . 
It was surprisingly difficult to get the different perspectives from multiple photos to 
meld together. I discovered a lot about the three -dimensionality of Moore’s sculpture 
from making the model. In particular, I learned about the positive and negative sp aces 
in the interior of this opened up form, significantly entitled Reclining Figure: Holes . 
In the end, after making several clay models, I concluded that the heavy log I had 
moved from Philadelphia to Chatham  was not appropriate for a figure like Moore’s. 
I rotated the log and began to open it up using all my tools to create interesting 
negative spaces and exterior forms. Eventually, it evolved into my final sculpture of 2019: Return of the Osprey . This was my most complex sculpture to date, with many 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         252 
positive and negative forms flowing in and out of each other.  (See section below on 
“Opening Up a Wood Log.”)

Creating a Set of Oak Sculptures  
It was a dark and stormy night in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, when I heard a loud 
crash in the middle of a torrential lightning storm. The next morning , I found that a 
large limb from a two -hundred -year-old oak tree had been flung by the storm against 
our garage wall and had smashed an open window to pieces. After I sawed up the 
heavy branch and dragged the logs off to our woodpile, it struck me that this  was a 
gift from heaven. I was just starting a sabbatical from teaching and the logs inspired me to mak e time now to return to my wood carving after a hiatus of more than a 
decade. 
  
It is usual to let wood dry out slowly , so it does not check and split. But I knew that 
dry oak would be hard to carve and that I could make much faster progress if I carved 
the wood while it was still green and then treated it carefully so that it would dry 
without checking. This worked amazin gly well. I carved the sculptures so that no 
volume would be too thick, so that outside layers would not dry out faster than 
interiors and cause strains. I was able to finish the carving before the freezing nights of winter came, and I oiled the sculptures well to prevent rapid drying and cracking.  
(I later learned that Moore had also become impatient with the years it would take to 
dry out the large tree trunk he had for his Reclining Figure: Holes . He took a similar 
approach of carving the green wood and protecting it from checking.)  
I mad e four sculptures from the oak and then went on to carve a more ambitious 
piece from a cherry tree log that a friend had brought me from his back yard in Illinois. The creation of these sculptures is documented here. 
The first sculpture I did was relatively simple, to ease me back into the process. I took  
as a goal  the elegant, elongated  form of Brancusi's Bird in Flight, which he had cast in 
metal. I challenged myself to see how well I could reproduce this from a log. Brancusi 
had reduced the image of a bird in flight to a simple, abstract, streamlined form. As I 
worked on it, I discovered the subtle complexity of his form and adapted it to the log 
I worked on, which I had selected for this project.

the original log, (b) the log carved by gouge and mallet,  (c) the piece smoothed with the 
Sureform rasp, and (d) the final sanded and oiled sculpture.  
The next sculpture was also an upright form, but I wanted to open it up. In earlier  
pieces, I had found that a vertical opening could be formed as the pairing of two 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         255 
vertical masses  (like legs) , with the opening scooped out between them and defining 
them as separate forms. This time I added an opening from above, so that the negative 
form from above flows into the opening below. I tried to develop contrasting forms 
coming out the top to add to t he asymmetry of the piece —resulting in a vaguely 
male/female contrast, supported by a lower -leg-like femur structure.

Hermaphrodite . White o ak. Philadelphia. 2010.  
The third sculpture was based on the principle that a sculpture should be compact 
enough to roll down a hill without its parts breaking off. I started with a football shape 
that one could cuddle in one ’s lap, like a cat with its head stretching out to be rubbed. 
The concavity that opened the form without penetrating it was based on a water -
polished rock I found during my explorations at Lake Powell earlier that summer. I 
left the bottom rounded so that t he piece could be held, fondled, and then set down 
to rock and find its own center of gravity. The beak -like ending of the elongated neck 
gave the piece a strong resemblance to a Mexican duck sculpture that I always 
treasured .

balanced in motion.

Creating an Open Cherry Trunk  
My last sculpture of the year 2010 was more ambitious  than the four oak pieces . The 
log consisted of  the starts to  four branches , so I turned it upside down and used three 
of them for legs. Again, I wanted to open the wood up to get away from the simple 
log shape and to explore the interior of the cherry tree. I broke through two cavernous 
openings from the back and scooped out much of the mass in the front, behin d and 
below a prominent beak form that emerged from the fourth branch.  
The openings once more evolved from holes in the wood to spaces surrounding new 
positive forms defined by the negative spaces. They contributed to a spiraling motion 
that I used to animate the log. I then added decorative touches to enliven the piece further: a piercing eye next to the beak and a flowing channel to add to the spiral. The 
feet were given various pointed forms to lift the piece off its base. All of this emerged 
gradually as I worked on the wood and studied its development and its needs. Cherr y 
wood has a variety of structural details, which I tried to uncover and retain, from beautiful patterns just below the bark to interior crevices filled with sap  or resin .

Creating an Upright Cherry Figure  
In the summer of 2000, I attended a conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A friend 
had brought along  in his pickup truck a large  cherry wood limb from a tree in his back 
yard in Illinois. He intended to bring it to my home  in Boulder, Colorado,  since he 
knew I liked to carve wood. I helped him on the drive and we read about philosophical 
controversies involving intersubjectivity to pass the time. Fifteen years somehow 
passed until I both wrote an essay on intersubjectivity and carved the log.  
At some point during the intervening 15 years, I carved some of the middle area of 
the limb down to 4" x 4" to see what the heartwood looked like. I had thought about 
shaping the log in a bone form, like a femur with a ball -and-joint socket. When I lost 
weight, I thought of carving a long, thin image of myself. I probably considered other 
ideas, but never started on any of them.  
On September 28, 2015, I decided to start removing some areas of the log to begin 
to break away from the original log shape , which is still visible in the following  
pictures . Also visible are the cuts I made with a chainsaw to facilitate carving out the 
areas.  
 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         261 
 
Over the next several days of carving, I roughed out the forms of the sculpture using 
my favorite large gouge and mallet. That was good exercise.  
 
 
  

Works of 3 -D Form  
         262 
 
At this point, I had roughed in some of the bone form and the ball for the joint. 
However, the sculpture still looked too log -like and symmetrical to me. I felt a need 
to break through the solid log cylinder. This would also cut through levels of grain to 
the darkly colored heartwood, just as my carving had begun to do in various areas of 
the log. S o, I drilled some starter holes with my electric drill and then gouged out a 
passageway through the cylinder. As I integrated this into the sculpture, twisting asymmetries began to evolve  and a larger variety of forms took shape, adding 
considerably to the  interest of the scul pture, without destroying its unity.  
 
People sometimes ask if I have an image of the sculpture in my head before I start to 
work on it (the Platonic theory) or if I just let the image that is inherent in the log 
come to light ( Michelangelo’s  claim). It is really much more of an emergent process 
that takes place through the direct carving techniques I use. Certainly, I start with 
some ideas that I want to explore and I start with a log that has interesting potentials. 
But the interaction betwe en material and eye incorporates  these in a much more  subtle 
interaction. If one works from a model or from the nature of the log, then you have to wonder why that model  (and pose) or that particular log (and orientation) was 
selected; t here is generally some rough vision  at work, although it may be substantially 
transformed as it gets worked out and evolves through the various stages of 
development.  
Since I do not try to represent  or re- present  some model or objec t, I am free to 
explore, modify and  refine to achieve various goals. I am interested in defining 3 -D 
forms, which look quite different from alternative  vantage points and which guide the 
caressing hand. I turn the worked -on sculpture around frequently and feel the volume 
and flow of the contributing forms with my hands. I love the beauty of wood as an 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         263 
organic product of growth, so my carving explores its layers of grai n and its unique 
twists. I use  natural Tung wood oil as a finish to keep the wood alive and lustrous. It 
comes alive with the oiling and comes into its own final appearance. With periodic 
oiling, a wood sculpture can live indefinitely long, at least for centuries.  
Because of the organic nature of my sculpture and its constituent forms, the finished 
works often remind people of natural and even human figures. In part , this is because 
my forms and their interconnections tend to follow the laws of organic growth. They exhibit a massing, sense of materiality and sensuousness of form , which may feel 
familiar from objects in the world. The forms are  appealing to the eye and the touch , 
partly because they are both similar and, in certain ways, different from natural 
objects .  
It is interesting that my first two wood sculptures are particularly suggestive to many 
viewers. People often say Gelassenheit  looks like an elephant, although I avoided 
imposing any representative forms on that log. Rather, I tried to make the forms look and feel massive. I guess that elephants also have massive forms ( large head, powerful 
trunk, floppy ears, sturdy legs, lumbering body). And Twisted Sister always reminds 
people of ET, although the movie came out a couple of years after the sculpture was 
finished. Apparently, the degree of abstraction from the human figure is similar in the 
two figures —and the eyes of both are appealing . 
Sculpture is a unique art form in that it is three -dimensional. It not only fills and 
shapes space, but it creates a special space ( Heidegger's theory) in which it s event of 
“presencing ” unfolds. Whereas painting only suggests perspective and tricks  the eye, 
sculpture beckons the observer's body to interact and move around the piece, taking 
up infinite different physical perspectives on it. People  are much more oriented to 
sight than to any other sense for observing and understanding the world. Vision is two-dimensional, capturing only that side of objects that currently face us. Perhaps 
infants, who put things in their mouth to explore them, or blind people, who touch 
surfaces, have more of a 3 -D sense. However, it seems that the human brain is 
primarily wired (or trained) to understand 2 -D forms much better than 3 -D forms. 
Creating and experiencing sculpture may provide a corrective to this rather severe 
limitation. 
While impressionist painting began to display the materiality of light, paint and 
brushstroke, wood sculpture brings out the nature of the wood: its size, shape, weight 
and volume, but also its roughness (or smoothness) of surface and the unending 
complexity of its coloring and graining. The growth history of trees like oak an d cherry 
are intricate on many scales and they are captured in the cell structure and displayed in the grain of the sculptural surface.

         264 
 
 
After I roughed in the 3- D forms of the log, I used  a large rasp to remove the gouge 
marks and to refine the curving surfaces. All my wood sculptures have been created 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         265 
using the same basic tools and techniques. This gives a unity to my wood sculpture 
gallery— along with a diversity based on different tree species, sizes and shapes. My 
pieces have smooth flowing surfaces, in part due to the large rasp work.  
Rasping was followed by sanding. I started with #5 0 rough sandpaper to smooth the 
surfaces. And gradually worked up to #1000 very fine sandpaper as well as wet -and-
dry sandpaper and #0000 very fine steel wool to give the surface a smooth touch.  
 
 
 

Works of 3 -D Form  
         266 
 
Finally, I oiled the wood with pure Tung oil. This brought out the incredible color of 
the cherry wood, which I had worked so hard to reveal as the forms cut across the 
multi -color bands of grain. I oiled the scu lpture each day for several days, rubbing it 
with a cloth and preparing for each coat with the steel wool.

The sculpture took about three weeks to create . Most days I worked on it for a couple 
of hours. 
After a sculpture is finished and displayed, it generally ripens in color or darkens over 
time. Cherry wood , in particular , develops a deep red tone that continues to mature 
for years.   
On November 3, I took the sculpture out in the back yard to get some sunshine.

Opening Up a n English Plane Log 
When we took down a towering English Plane tree leaning out over the koi pond and 
threatening our house in Philadelphia, I had the arborist save a log from a bend near 
the top of the trunk. I had in mind carving it based on a favorite Henry Moore 
sculpture  from a huge elm trunk, Reclining Figure: Holes . This was a complicated 
undertaking, so I put it off for almost a decade. Then I did a few clay models to understand the overall structure in 3-D, including the many  holes opening it up, which 
were important enough for Moore that he named  his piece accordingly.  
However, when I finally got up my nerve to tackle the log, I soon discovered that it 
would not work  as anything like Moore’s sculpture. So , I re-oriented the log upright 
and decided to just follow the lead of the evolving structure. I made some chainsaw 
cuts to define rough features and then I started to drill out s everal  openings through 
the log to open it up. I used approaches I had developed in working on smaller 
abstract ceramic sculptures. I then carved the openings of the holes to flow through 
the pie ce from the exterior curves and forms.  
As I worked on the log with my gouge, numerous 3- D forms emerged, intricately 
connected and leading in and out of the holes. On the top was a dramatic slab of wood, which I decided to carve into the head of an osprey, giving my sculpture the 
name “ Return of the Osprey .” 
Ospreys are graceful large raptor birds that are again becoming common on Cape 
Cod. In recent  decades, ospreys almost died out. DDT pesticides being used for 
farming and gardening were affecting the eggs of ospreys, so that most of the ir eggs 
broke prematurely. With the banning of DDT, the osprey population i s now returning 
from the brink of human -caused extinction. I celebrate  their return with my sculpture, 
recognizing one instance in which people reversed their ecologically destructive 
practices in time to do some good.  
This sculpture turned out to be one of my largest (and heaviest), as well as my most 
complex works. The opening up of the log involves large and interconnected 
passageways, most of which flow into the surrounding outer curves and forms. While 
the overall s hape of the piece may portray an upright bird perched on its nest, with 
sharp beak ready for fishing, the details require running one ’s fingers along individual 
transitions between forms and peering into the interior from different angles in 
diverse lighti ng. It takes time and effort to understand the sculpture. 
Because of its skewed balance and considerable mass, the sculpture is bolted to a 
heavy base, carved from an oak cross- section gifted by Holly in Maine, via an oak 
board attached to the sculpture’s bottom.

Creating an Angel in Space  
After returning from Florida at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I sheltered in my 
basement studio and focused on casting ceramic sculptures. Then I spent August 
carving the trunk of a cherry tree that Alan and Bill had cut down and saved for me.  
I started by roughing the log in with a chainsaw, guided by a 10" clay model. This 
allowed me to remove large masses of the cylindrical log to start to define a structure 
of limbs spiraling up from a base, as well as to poke through a series of interconnected 
openings going completely through the log. Prominent features  of the angel were also 
roughed in: head, chest, abdomen.

The wings are an add -on from a board. This was suggested by totem  poles from the 
Northwest, which attach wings to thunderbirds. The base is a rough log from a pine 
tree that was downed at a neighbor’s house during a hurricane. I cut chunks of the 
large pine trunk and trimmed one down for this base, which is entirely shap ed by the 
chainsaw. The base was needed to raise the angel and to stabilize its potentially top -
heavy mass.  
 
The theme, Angel of Progress, comes from Walter Benjamin’s 9th Thesis on the 
Philosophy of History:  
“A Klee painting named ‘Angelus Novus’ shows an angel looking as though 
he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His 
eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one 
pictures the angel of history. His fa ce is turned toward the past. Where we 
perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, 
awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is 
blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence 
that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him 
into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before 
him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. ” 
In 1940, when fascism enveloped Europe, eventually leaving him no escape but 
suicide, Benjamin wrote this set of theses, questioning the Marxist optimism about 
historical progress. The “Angel of the New” is caught in a chaotic storm, which 
prevents a forwa rd-looking view and dumps an ever- growing pile of debris at his feet.

In the apotheosis of governmental lawlessness, unrestrained health pandemic, 
potential financial collapse, increasing economic inequality, ideological division and 
impending climate change, it seemed to me time to ponder an angel of progress again. 
My newer angel is inscrutable, looking neither forward nor backward, expressing 
neither hope nor redemption, blankly hovering amidst whatever may come or go  or 
pile up . The winds blow through her, and she persists with the solid material of wood 
that lives on aft er its trees are gone.  
      
Like my other recent wood sculptures, I aimed to open up space and escape the solid, symmetric cylindrical form of the original log. In particular, I built upon the approach 
to multiple intersecting openings in Mrs. Mayo  and Return of the Osprey . While the foot 
of the sculpture retains the circumference of the log, the base it sits on extends outside to broaden the space somewhat. The wings reach out even much further, to open , 
define and pierce  a larger encompassing space, without pretending to be an entir ely 
integral part of the original log. 
The negative forms of the openings and of the cutaways that lead to them define 
positive structural limbs that support the angel -like legs, spiraling around a central 
hollow. The forms of these legs result largely from the studies of structure in my abstract ceramic sculptures. As indications of structure, the positive forms of the 
lower part of the sculpture indicate or outline the  angel’s hips and legs, while removing 
their gravitational mass and allowing the body to flow lightly around and to suspend 
the figure almost in flight.

The forms that enclose the central openings of the lower half of the angel are masses 
designed to reveal the power and beauty of the cherry wood. Note, for instance, how

thin some of the joints are where structures merge into each other. The curves and 
angles of these forms are designed to bring out the grain of the log, which grows in 
concentric rings following the vertical of the log. To expose interesting grain patterns , 
one must cut into the log and even across the log (as atop the head).

Con-Struction in M useum  of Art  Exhibit 
Sculpture accepted for the international juried exhibit “In Tandem” at the Cape Cod 
Museum of Art, May 10 - July 30, 2023.  
“Con -Struction .” Sculpture from a single cooper beech tree log, on sycamore base. Created in 
Chatham, MA, January 2023. Base: 11”x 18”, height: 18”. Log found by Tom Getz. Carved as 
five separate forms and mounted in tandem.  
 
The title “Con -Struction” combines the Latin terms for “with” and “fitting together.” 
The five constituent forms of the sculpture fit together with each other to produce a 
composite structure. They work with each other in tandem, becoming individually 
subordinate to the piece as a con -structed unit. While each of the five individual forms 
has some complexity of shape and often includes a small central opening, the sculpture as a whole has many times the complexity and opens up significantly more 
interior sp ace. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts due to the physical and 
spatial connections through which the parts fit together.  
Since 1976, I have carved wood sculptures with biomorphic or organic three -
dimensional forms, which contrast with the geometric shapes of manufactured 
commodities. Their embodied forms are nuanced and asymmetrical; they present 
different, often surprising views from alternative perspectives. By cutting across the 
growth pattern of the tree, I strive to bring out lively grain patterns. Finishing smooth curves and surfaces with natural wood oil, I revive and preserve the life of the wood. 
In a piece like Con -Struction, the organic parts work in tandem to form an organism, 
which cannot be reduced to the functioning of its individual parts.  
I have increasingly endeavored to “open up” the material of my sculptures during my 
focus on ceramic and wood sculpture since retiring to Cape Cod in 2015. When 
working on logs, this involves piercing into the core wood and creating interior spaces. 
The negative space s of the openings become equally important sculptural forms. They 
allow light and sight to flow into and through the usually opaque volumes. Often, cavernous spaces are created, stimulating primordial images of shelter and endowing 
abstract 3 -D space with elemental form, complex structure and human meaning.  
Con-Struction is the latest in a series of wood sculptures where I have opened up the 
log from a tree by sawing it into two to five segments. I then carved the individual 
segments separately, allowing me easier access to internal areas and facilitating the  
effort of creating negative volumes. In order to maintain a view of how the parts will 
work in tandem, I generally develop a ceramic maquette of the overall intended 
design, working out the positive and negative spaces and relationships for the 
assembled final piece. The specific forms and eventual surfaces of the wood emerge 
largely through  the work of carving, so the finished wood sculpture differs 
Works of 3 -D Form  
         281 
significantly in detail from the ceramic maquette. However, the approach to opening 
up the material and the way the parts work together, abutting each other and framing 
negative spaces, persist  from the conceptual model to the finished product. 
The primary tandem relationship is that of sculptor to sculpture. The sculptor’s 
experienced hand and eye respond to intimate perceptions of the evolving materials 
and work. Even for someone who has worked extensively in 3 -D, it is challenging to 
plan, visualize and work in the round. Human understanding is primarily formed through 2 -D experiences of visual perception. Thinking deeply about a complex 
object from multiple perspectives requires prolonged interaction with the object as it emerges from its raw materials  ... and even living with the sculpture after it is finished. 
Such interaction builds upon  experience in the many stages of crafting sculpture and 
upon experiments with series of attempts at related aims. Con -Struction benefits from  
my previous carvings that investigated biomorphic form, opening up solids, creating negative space and dividing a log into multiple pieces that work in tandem.

3-Tiered Tower 
   
Three-Tiered Tower . Tier one and tier two in pine; tier three in cherry. Chatham, February 
2022. Hwd: 40”x 18”x 14”. This is my most complex sculpture to date in terms of the 
number of distinct 3 -D forms interwoven. I started by roughing in the structure of the 
stacked tiers based on the ceramic maquettes; then the individual forms evolved as I refined 
the sculpture. The major openings span adjoining tiers, revealing the vertical support structure.
