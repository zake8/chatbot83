Wing Chun
(Redirected from Ving Tsun)
Wing Chun  (Cantonese) or Yongchun (Mandarin) (Chinese: 詠春 or 咏春, lit. "singing
spring")[7] is a concept-based martial art, a form of Southern Chinese kung fu, and a close-
quarters system of self-defense. It is a martial arts style characterized by its focus on close-
quarters hand-to-hand combat, rapid-fire punches, and straightforward efficiency. It has a
philosophy that emphasizes capturing and sticking to an opponent's centerline. This is
accomplished using simultaneous attack and defense, tactile sensitivity, and using an
opponent's force against them.
Wing Chun has various spellings in the West, but "Wing Chun" is the most common.[8][9]
The origins of Wing Chun are uncertain, but it is generally attributed to the development of
Southern Chinese martial arts. There are at least eight distinct lineages, of which the Ip Man
and Yuen Kay-shan lineages are the most prolific.
The martial art was brought to Hong Kong and then the rest of the world by Ip Man, with
Bruce Lee being his most famous student. The Ving Tsun Athletic Association, founded in
1967 by Ip Man and his students, helped spread Wing Chun globally. Traditionally taught
within a family system, modern Wing Chun lessons have taken on a more academic and
commercial character.
Wing Chun gained popularity in the 2010s due to the Ip Man film series starring Donnie Yen
and has been featured in video games like Tekken 7. Notable practitioners include Bruce Lee,
Donnie Yen, Samuel Kwok, and Carlos Deleon.
In Chinese, this martial art is referred to as 咏春拳 (simplified script) or 詠春拳 (traditional
script). Though it is written in an almost identical way in traditional and simplified, it is not
pronounced and transcribed in the same way according to the regions and their dialects:
Yǒngchūn quán  in Mandarin pinyin, Wing-Chun keen  in Cantonese Wade-Giles. It is
made up of 2 terms: 拳 (quan/kuen) which means "fist, boxing" and the term 詠春 (wing-
chun, in Cantonese) meaning "singing spring". The full name is thus translated as "singing
spring boxing".[5][6]
In its short designation, the martial art is simply designated by these two sinograms:
the sinogram 詠 yǒng/wing: "to sing, to sing..."
the sinogram 春 chūn/chun: "spring, vitality..."
This martial art is sometimes referred to by 永春, characters different from 詠春, but
pronounced and transcribed in the same way: They are literally translated as "eternal
spring", the character 永 meaning "eternal, endless". These characters also designate the
Yongchun region near the city of Quanzhou (Fujian).
If the use of 詠春 seems privileged today for Wing Chun styles, 永春 still appears in the name
of other Southern Chinese martial arts (with 永春 often transcribed Weng Chun ); for
example jee shim weng chun and Yǒng Chūn Bái Hè Quán ( 永春白鶴拳 ).[10]
In the West, the name of this martial art has been transcribed variably due to the use of different or
personal Chinese language romanization methods, and differences in pronunciation between
Chinese languages (but Cantonese was often preferred) or according to Western languages. In
addition, some Wing Chun masters voluntarily created their own terms, in order to dissociate their
personal teaching from traditional teachings. For example, Yip Man's Ving Tsun or Leung Ting's
Wing Tsun.
The consequence is the ability to determine a lineage, a student-teacher family tree, just by
spelling.

Finally, this martial art is pronounced quite identically in the West but is written with many spellings: Ving Tsun, Wing Tsun, Wing
Tsung, Yong Chun, Weng Chun, Wyng Tjun, Ving Tjun, Wing Tzun, Wing Tschun. Wing Chun is the most common form, used to apply to
all lineages of this martial art.[12][9]
Context of the name Wing Chun varies between various branches of Wing Chun. Common legend is that the name is derived from Yim
Wing-chun, the mythical progenator of the martial art, who was a student of the legendary Abbess Ng Mui.[13][14][15]
According to the Hung Suen / Hung Gu Biu lineage, the Ng Mui / Yim Wing Chun legend was conceived to protect the identity of Cheung
Ng, a Shaolin monk who survived the Manchurian massacres and took refuge at Red Boat Opera. The "Yim Wing Chun" name was
chosen for specific reasons, as Yim could be understood as the word for "Secret" or "Protected", and "Wing Chun" refers to Siu Lam Wing Chun
Tong (the Always Spring Hall). With "Yim Wing Chun" being a secret code for "the secret art of Siu Lam Wing Chun Hall."[16]
In the Pan Nam lineage, the "Wing" in Wing Chun comes from Chan Wing-wah, one of the founders of Hongmen.[17] According to the Pao Fa
Lien lineage, the name Wing Chun is a shortened form of the revolutionary motto, "Wing yun chi jee; Mo mong Hon Juk; Dai dei wu chun." A
secret code that allowed the anti-Qing revolutionaries to recognize each other. Eventually, the codeword was shortened to Wing Chun (Always
Spring.)[18]
The definitive origin of Wing Chun remains unknown and is attributed to the development of Southern Chinese martial arts.[19] Complications
in the history and documentation of Wing Chun are attributed to the art being passed from teacher to student orally, rather than in writing.
Another reason is the secrecy of its development, due to its connections to Anti-Qing rebellious movements.[20]
There are at least eight different distinct lineages of Wing Chun, each having its own history of origin. Additionally, there are competing
genealogies within the same branch or about the same individual teacher. The eight distinct lineages of Wing Chun which have been identified
are:
Ip Man[21]
Yuen Kay-shan[22][23]
Gu Lao Village [24][25]Nanyang / Cao Dean[26]
Pan Nam[27]
Pao Fa Lien[28]Hung Suen / Hung Gu Biu [29]
Jee Shim[30] / Weng Chun[31]
Regardless of the origins espoused by various Wing Chun branches and lineages, there is much third-party controversy and speculative
theorizing regarding the true origins of Wing Chun. In the West, Wing Chun's history has become a mix of fact and fiction due to the impacts of
early secrecy and modern marketing.[1]
Of the eight Wing Chun lineages,[32] the Ip Man and Yuen Kay-shan lineages are the most prolific branches of Wing Chun worldwide.[33][34][35]
The other lineages are pretty much unknown outside of China, except for the Pan Nam line, which survives in the USA[36][37] and the Jee Shim
/ Weng Chun line with a strong presence in Germany.[38][39] The Yuen Chai Wan form of Wing Chun[b] has a notable presence in Vietnam,
with this lineage having earned the moniker of " Vietnamese Wing Chun".[40][41][42][43][44]
In 1949 Ip Man, considered the most important grandmaster of modern Wing Chun, brought the style from China to Hong Kong and
eventually to the rest of the world.[21][45][46][47] Yip Man's most famous student was Bruce Lee, who had studied under Yip Man before he
moved to the United States.[c][49] Lee is also credited for popularizing Wing Chun internationally,[50][51] although he would later develop his
own martial arts philosophies (namely Jeet Kune Do) that contain many Wing Chun influences.[3][52] Some masters changed the way of
teaching only 1 loyal student because it was a tradition that came because of Qing dynasty's influence and destruction of Southern Shaolin, in
order to preserve the style, ancient masters taught only 1 loyal student.
The Ving Tsun Athletic Association was founded in 1967 by Cantonese master Ip Man and seven of his senior students so they could teach
Wing Chun together and Ip Man would not take on all the work himself.[53] The first public demonstration of the Wing Chun fighting system,
according to Ip Man, took place in Hong Kong at an official exhibition fight in the winter of 1969 at what was then the Baptist College (now the
Hong Kong Baptist University). Leung Ting, a student of Ip Man, invited his master and some well-known representatives of the martial arts
scene of the time to the college and conducted the exhibition fights in front of a specialist audience. The Association helped Wing Chun to
spread to the rest of the world.[54][55]
There is no uniform umbrella organization in Europe under which Wing Chun practitioners are grouped, but rather numerous, sometimes
competing and divided associations, schools, and individual teachers. Most associations do not appear in the legal form of associations that
have voluntarily merged to form an association, but as commercial organizations in which associated schools are integrated, which are
authorized and certified by the association. Some of the associations are organized in a franchise system.Context

Butterfly SwordsIn some associations, based on the family system that was used in the past, obedience and obligations towards the master and his teacher are
emphasized, although these are rarely directly related to their training students.
Wing Chun puts emphasis on economic movement and encourages its practitioners to "feel" through their opponents' defenses and to utilize
the incoming attacks with deflection, rapid punches, and finger pokes. Slapping and defensive maneuvers are used to distract the opponent to
make them shift their defenses away from their centerline.[15]
Wing Chun favors a relatively high, narrow stance with the elbows close to the body. Within the stance, arms are generally positioned across
the vital points of the centerline with hands in a vertical "wu sau" ("protecting hand" position).[56] This puts the practitioner in a position to
make readily placed blocks and fast-moving blows to vital striking points down the center of the body, i.e. the neck, chest, belly, and groin.
Shifting or turning within a stance is done on the heels, balls, or middle (K1 or Kidney point 1) of the foot, depending on the lineage. Some
Wing Chun styles discourage the use of high kicks because this risks counter-attacks to the groin. The practice of "settling" one's opponent to
brace them more effectively against the ground helps one deliver as much force as possible.[57][58]
Softness (via relaxation) and performance of techniques in a relaxed manner, and by training the physical, mental, breathing, energy, and force
in a relaxed manner to develop Chi "soft wholesome force",[59] is fundamental to Wing Chun.[15] On "softness" in Wing Chun, Ip Man said
during an interview:
Wing Chun is in some sense a "soft" school of martial arts. However, if one equates that word as weak or without strength, then they
are dead wrong. Chi Sau in Wing Chun is to maintain one's flexibility and softness, all the while keeping in the strength to fight back,
much like the flexible nature of bamboo".[60]
In ancient China, Wing Chun, like all other martial arts or craft guilds, was traditionally passed on in a familiar way, from master to student.
The master, who had personal responsibility for the entire training of the student (apprentice), was addressed as Sifu (master). The lessons
often took place in the master's house, where a personal bond would develop between the master and his family and the student (apprentice),
with certain mutual obligations. The first public martial arts schools were established in Hong Kong. Since then, Wing Chun's lessons have
taken on a more modern, academic, and commercial character.
In some schools, however, the family system was still maintained. Lo Man-Kam, a nephew of Ip Man, still teaches his students in his home in
Taipei. Suitable selected long-term students are still accepted into the inner circle of the Wing Chun family by the Sifu in the traditional way,
through a master-student tea ceremony. This ceremony underlines the deep personal bond that has developed between master and student
through the long training period.
The most common system of forms in Wing Chun consists of three empty hand forms, two weapon forms: the Dragon
pole and Butterfly swords, and a wooden dummy form.[61]
The first and most important form in Wing Chun, siu nim tau  (simplified Chinese: 小念头; traditional Chinese: 小念
頭; pinyin: xiǎo niàn tou ; Jyutping: siu2 nim6 tau4 ; lit. 'little idea for beginning'[63]), is practiced throughout the
practitioner's lifetime.[64] It is the foundation or "seed" of the art, on which all succeeding forms and techniques are
based.[65] Fundamental rules of balance and body structure are developed here. Using a car analogy; for some
branches this would provide the chassis[66] and for others, this is the engine.[67] It serves as the basic alphabet of the system. Some branches
view the symmetrical stance as the fundamental fighting stance, while others see it as a training stance used in developing technique.[68]
Although many of the movements are similar, siu nim tau varies significantly between the different branches of Wing Chun. In Ip Man's Wing
Chun, the first section of the form is done by training the basic power for the hand techniques by tensing and relaxing the arms.[69] In Moy
Yat's Wing Chun, the first section of the form is done without muscle tension and slowly in a meditative, calm, and being "in the moment" way.
[64] In 1972, weeks before he died, Ip Man demonstrated Siu Nim Tau (also known as Siu Lim Tau) on film, showing how the form is to beCharacteristics

performed.[70]
The second form, chum kiu simplified Chinese: 寻桥; traditional Chinese: 尋橋; pinyin: xún qiáo ; Jyutping: cham4 kiu4 ; lit. 'seeking the
bridge', focuses on coordinated movement of body mass and entry techniques to "bridge the gap" between practitioner and opponent, and
move in to disrupt their structure and balance.[71][72] Close-range attacks using the elbows and knees are also developed here. It also teaches
methods of recovering position and centerline when in a compromised position where Siu Nim Tau structure has been lost. For some branches,
bodyweight in striking is a central theme, either from pivoting (rotational) or stepping (translational). Likewise, for some branches, this form
provides the engine to the car. For branches that use the "sinking bridge" interpretation, the form has more emphasis on "uprooting", adding
multi-dimensional movement and spiraling to the already developed engine.
The third and last form, biu jeeChinese: 镖指; pinyin: biāo zhǐ; Jyutping: biu1 ji2; lit. 'darting fingers', is composed of extreme short-range and
extreme long-range techniques, low kicks and sweeps, and "emergency techniques" to counter-attack when structure and centerline have been
seriously compromised, such as when the practitioner is seriously injured.[73], As well as the pivoting and stepping developed in Chum Kiu, a
third degree of freedom, involves more upper body, and stretching is developed for more power. Such movements include close-range elbow
strikes and finger thrusts to the throat. For some branches, this is the turbo-charger of the car; for others, it can be seen as a "pit stop" kit that
should never come into play, recovering your "engine" when it has been lost. Still, other branches view this form as imparting deadly "killing"
and maiming techniques that should never be used without good reason. A common Wing Chun saying is, "Biu jee doesn't go out the door".
Some interpret this to mean the form should be kept secret; others interpret it as meaning it should never be used if you can help it.
Mu ren zhuang ( simplified Chinese: 木人桩; traditional Chinese: 木人樁; pinyin: mù rén zhuāng ; Jyutping:
muk6 yan4 jong1 ; lit. 'wooden dummy') is performed on a wooden dummy, which serves as a training tool
to teach the student the use of Wing Chun Kuen's 108 movements against a live opponent.[15] There are
many versions of this form which come from a variety of Wing Chun Kung Fu lineages.
San Sik (Chinese: 散式; Cantonese Yale: Sáan Sīk; pinyin: S ǎn Shì; 'Separate forms'), along with the other
three forms, is the basis of all Wing Chun techniques. They are compact in structure, and can be loosely
grouped into three broad categories: (1) Focus on building body structure through basic punching,
standing, turning, and stepping drills; (2) Fundamental arm cycles and changes, firmly ingraining the
cardinal tools for interception and adaptation; (3) Sensitivity training and combination techniques.[74]
The Yuen Kay Shan / Sum Nung branch also historically trained to throw darts (Biu).[75]
Donnie Yen played the role of Wing Chun Grandmaster Ip Man in the 2008 movie Ip Man, and in its sequels Ip Man 2 , Ip Man 3,  and Ip Man
4.[76][77] The Ip Man series of movies is credited for reviving interest in the martial art in the 2010s and the Ip Man trilogy received critical
acclaim in the box office. Ip Man was Bruce Lee's master, which made the trilogy so popular. Lee was largely responsible for launching the
"kung fu craze" of the 1970s.[78][79][80][81][82][83]
For the 2008 American action thriller film Bangkok Dangerous , actor Nicolas Cage trained in Wing Chun extensively. A particular scene in the
film shows Cage’s skills whilst drilling moves with another Wing Chun practitioner (played by Thai actor Shahkrit Yamnam).[84]
In December 2019, a new Wing Chun fighter named Leroy Smith was introduced to the fighting game Tekken 7  roster as downloadable
content.[85][86][87] When creating characters to represent real-world martial arts, the developers wanted to introduce a new fighter utilizing
Wing Chun. The developers consulted a student of Ip Man's nephew, who provided motion capture for the character.[88]
