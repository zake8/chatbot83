Thank you.
How's it going?
Christian, good to see you.
How are you?
Good, good.
How are you?
I'm great, thank you.
Everybody's good?
Yeah.
Good, good, good.
Ready for Christmas, huh?
Hi, Julie.
Hey, Sifu.
Good for you guys.
Hi, Big.
Hey, Gerard.
Hey.
Hey for Mike.
How's it going?
Hi, Mike.
How are you?
Great, thank you.
Good to see you.
Hi, everyone.
Mario.
Hey, Sifu.
Hi, Sifu.
How's everyone?
Hi, Mustafa.
Good to see you, too.
How you hanging?
Good?
Nice.
Hi, Sifu.
How are you, buddy?
Hey, Vic.
Cool.
So, last night,
Sifu,
Henry and Mike
called me.
I was happy to hear from
check-in,
see how I'm doing.
He's good.
He's healthy.
And he said
the Mogoon
is kind of slow.
But I get him to talk about
a few things.
And
funny, he bring up the Guan.
And
yeah,
the way he language it
is clear.
It's clear.
It's about yin-yang.
He want to remind us
if you go down,
you have to think up.
You know,
it says
six and a half,
actually one.
Left,
east, west,
north, south.
You see,
all become one to him.
He was on a,
he was
really on a roll
because
once he starts speaking
some of the things
in Chinese
and then tell me in English,
you know,
we are enjoying
the conversation.
So,
as a Sida,
I get to
motivate him
to share a little bit more.
So,
he want to say,
you really want the power.
Make sure
the feet are straight,
parallel.
Then you can get the most
out of your power,
of the Bu Guan.
But it's the horse.
It's all about the horse.
So,
he talk about a lot
of other Kung Fu styles too.
You know.
So,
anyway,
I was talking to him
on the computer
and I forgot
it was not plugged in
and doggone it,
it went off.
And so,
when I call back,
hey Pete,
I gotta go.
So, you know,
you lose those opportunities
because we start speaking
about the Guan
for a long while.
But,
it's very nice to hear
because
you really get
present, man.
Kung Fu is Kung Fu.
Kung Fu is Kung Fu.
And,
then I start to get present
why
I would hear
Grandmaster often talk about
special Wing Chun Kung Fu.
You know,
I mean Kung Fu is Kung Fu,
but
what made
what made them
really
so
almost
to this
almost to the edge
of insulting others.
Special Wing Chun Kung Fu.
Then after a while
I start to side with them.
I go,
wow,
this is for human beings.
That's the big difference
for the human intellect.
So,
so tonight
I just want to let you know
that
always
our family
somewhere
is paralleling us.
You know,
as we are separate
but connected.
And so,
whenever I meet
my Kung Fu brothers,
from South America
and North America,
all up to the same thing.
Training Wing Chun Kung Fu.
So, with that,
I'm really happy
to see you guys tonight
the week before Christmas.
So,
Vic, everything.
Thanks, Vic.
Look
at my beads, man.
So,
everybody's healthy.
So, tonight,
Vic,
let's,
Eddie,
call me.
He explained a few things, too.
So,
good.
I'm happy to hear you guys.
Hi, Eddie.
That's you, Eddie.
With that,
we can begin.
That was Kathleen.
Whoever Kathleen is.
Yeah.
I muted Kathleen
or Gino.
Fair.
That's Gino.
Okay.
Gino.
Yeah.
No worries.
Okay.
So,
we want to get started.
Last week,
we talked about
we completed
the Ba Cham Do
and
it introduced
the Phoenix Eye
because of the grip
and also
the striking
power
and
the game.
So, then the pole
is six and a half point pole,
mouse,
mouse tail pole.
Also,
dragon long pole.
There's a lot of names
for this particular pole.
So, the unification of the Phoenix and the dragon,
it was inevitable.
So, if you look at the history,
Eng Mui also studied dragon style.
And she helped found the Eng Mui fist,
Wing Chun Kung Fu,
Dragon style,
image.
And five image style,
which is five animal styles.
So, we covered
snake crane,
which is Wing Chun's inspiration.
We had the Tiger grip tiger mouth,
which coincides with the snake.
Then the crane goes with the leopard,
the leopard grip.
Especially with the Bi Yu Do.
The only thing left
is missing of the five animals
is the dragon style.
dragon. So ironically, Wenchuan people go annex or acquire the dragon hole. So they
complete back to the five animal system again. But be clear, in English or American English
especially, they say five animal style. But in Chinese, it's five image style. Because
a dragon is not an animal. So we have to be real clear on the distinction. And what's
important to note about the dragon, it's an imaginary object. Whether they exist or not,
nobody ever knows. But it requires you to use your imagination. So the last thing Wenchuan
felt it didn't have was that imagination. So the dragon long pole makes sense. Also,
it happens to be a long weapon.
If you look at this thinking of all those five images, just to not get confused,
five animal styles, they all have a certain nature. Tiger, snake, crane, leopard. But
the dragon is about imaginary. So you really have to focus on all your kung fu. The other
ones were about the technical kung fu, about understanding the nature of those animals.
But the dragon, particularly, is about imagination.
The dragon, particularly, is about how to be imaginative. How to go beyond your training.
So there'll be some things I'll post that you guys don't see people doing. And you could
tell me if it's a violation of the Wenchuan system. Because I personally know it's not.
But I train differently because that's the dragon imagination. So Einstein said it many
times that imagination is more important than intelligence.
So you can acquire all these different styles of kung fu, put it into Wenchuan, and say,
oh, I acquired all this intelligence. But you must use imagination to set it going.
And then on this scale, is imagination yin or yang?
You guys studied yin yang for how many weeks? Is imagination yin or yang?
I would say yin.
Yan.
You have half a chance right to be correct.
What's soft? Is yin soft?
Yes.
I would say yin, too.
OK. Well, it's yang. You have to use your imagination. It takes risk. Men take risk.
We don't stay on status quo. We don't try to find even keel, balance. So that's the
male nature.
You're going to get a chance.
You're going to get a chance.
You're going to get a chance.
That's the only thing.
I'm not going to say it's not.
It's not.
It's not.
But the only way to get a chance is to take a chance. See if it could spark something.
So when you train in an imaginative way, most people are going to judge you. Most people
are going to say, oh, that's not Wenchuan.
So I had this discussion with one of my students today, James. He's a power lifter coach.
He's also really good at massage therapy. And he always said it, that if I see your
school has weights, I'll never go to those schools. I know those schools are not about
kung fu so he used to think that way because his sifu i met him too sifu eric graham praying
mantis in georgia and his sifu is working with weights see so it's interesting that people
like to keep things in a time capsule stay this way don't ever change which if you want to preserve
a martial art makes a lot of sense so you want to keep the nature of it intact but you're training
you have all the green light to train any way you can but it must be tied into a development
to a purpose if you just want to walk around you can't clap your hands i wouldn't say that's
conducive to winchun practitioner you know you don't want to be this guy that's just so wide
he can't input his put you know feel his own elbow
so that's
totally different uh training that now you left the martial arts path but if you train with weights
it doesn't have to be weights could be anything it has to be functional development to help you
do better in your kung fu so the dragon pole look the implement one or uh
one two may shoot as a as a mouse may is a tail so mouse tail pole
so
is a mouse tail pole
it's a really interesting subject because the history goes
it was an exchange at the era of wong wapo and leong yi tai and it was from like what mario posted
is uh a monk his contemporary of ing mon uh he could call him chi xin chi xin sim sim si
so you hear the word si again si tou si fu uh si hing si dai si mui si jie si
si
sim si
si
si
is then teacher so in in japanese you hear zen but in chinese it's sim sim si so uh
he taught a zen as a as a culture and as a philosophy so he was the one that brought
and developed the dragon long pole now whether it was called look bimbo and guan yet on the boat no
nobody knows
so we didn't really enter into the ideas that
nobody knows
my guess is it's called dragon long pull or maybe mouse tail pole it could be wing chun's analytical skills that said let's make it six and a half point pole because by the time it got exchanged and passed down to dr long john it was very
uh detailed that's why he's also the doctor and the family
when you train, like why now we have a pole
is not really wen chun.
So my imaginative dragon nature,
because I'm most compatible with dragons,
just happens to be dragons and monkeys.
So I adopt that thinking.
So if you're imaginative, you wanna train using this kung fu.
For example, low stance will never help any
It won't help you and it won't hurt you.
So if you were to start new students
and have them do squatting or say ping ma stance,
it's never too early, but it definitely can be too late
because we age.
So let's say someone comes in, you're lucky, they're 30.
And they go, oh, you probably get to the pole in five years
if you're a really good student.
So that means they're starting to do that when they're 35.
So my way of looking at it is,
we're not fighting anyone with these weapons today,
but if you wanna be good at it,
you wanna perform it at the very least,
condition your body earlier.
Don't wait till after I learned the zhong,
then the most appropriate thing is the guan,
which I can't understand why people say that.
Because you go from playing the zhong
and you're more like a crane and a snake,
then you go jump in and you try to be a squatting nature.
And then you have to wait a period of perhaps a year,
and then you have to wait a period of perhaps a year,
and then you have to wait a period of perhaps a year,
until you're in practice, then you learn the dou.
So there's a kind of a mismatch
because even chronologically,
historically, it doesn't make sense.
So if you want someone to be good at the guan,
condition and train them early.
Okay, so that's how I'm gonna open it up.
So a lot of people played and contributed their guan form.
We can go right into that.
If you guys have any things you wanna add
or you wanna ask,
this is the great time
into the details of the form.
I have a question.
What's the translation of a look dim of the,
what's the translation of our?
Six and a half point pole.
Okay.
And,
and one of the reasons why we have that in our system is because we had a
short weapon and all Kung Fu systems have a long weapon and a short weapon.
Is that true?
No, that's not true either.
It's just that if you want to be complete,
you should have a long and a short.
Now if you go back to a muy and also G seem her,
I'm assuming it's her seating,
but let's say it,
regardless of their brother,
sister Kung Fu from challenge temple,
right?
It,
they talk about it.
There's a short bridge and a long bridge again,
repeatedly,
especially as it evolves to become home cream home cream has short and long
bridge.
So they have a,
a vast weaponry.
It's 18 weapons long and short and mid mid range.
They cover all of it.
But when China,
at some point they had to have interacted,
they've had to have,
you know,
collided connected in some point and go ahead and we don't have any mid range or long range
weapon.
So how do you match some of those?
Like Hongar has a tiger fork of one though one Guando long pole with the Guando on the
end.
Even you do Quan all day,
it's going to break your weapons.
It's so strong.
So then you need a pole because the pole meets the power,
the wheelhouse of that long range weapon sooner.
That's why,
that's why it has killing power.
So that we go at the weapon,
all of our weapons are two handed weapons.
The only difference with the Guan is,
is focused,
concentrated into one weapon.
There's no left.
There's no right.
You only use the right side.
Now you could be a Southpaw and train the left side,
but the tradition,
I'm going to stay in tradition mode.
It's right side because the yin yang is energy enters.
The left is the right.
That's just the way it is.
I don't ask me to explain.
Why can't it go out the end to the right about the left?
I'm just following what I understand of yin yang.
I don't know why it has to be in the left out the right.
That's that's just the way the I Ching set it up.
So that's the Kung Fu.
So if you look at like my my from my shoulder right here,
so my arms I close my arms.
So right here is a character long.
And right here.
Character that's called gate morning.
If you add a mouth here,
you have money.
So you have months name is right here.
There's a character at the mouth and you see the gate the arms.
So ironically,
when they say protect your inner gate outer gate,
they already match the body to the character.
It's so perfect.
So that's one more.
So you don't want anything to penetrate to hit the gate or to go through.
Your gate.
They go through you to go through the gate.
It's game over.
So the build one has the power to go through you.
So that's why it's nature is killed.
It's not going to break your arm or break your knee.
It's not even trying to chase the thigh,
which is a very big massive area of leg.
They find that to be a waste.
They go for the more the cavity all the organs.
So there's no place for the weapon.
It's like a 40,
45 caliber when it hits everything is ruptured.
Everything is destroyed.
You can't recover from that because it's scatters throughout the organs,
the body.
Okay,
but the bottom dough is nature is to main.
Now,
you can definitely kill with the knives,
but the maiming what makes the maiming so important is that it's Wing Chun's nature.
I don't need to kill you.
You just need to go home.
So if I fight and I took out your finger or your arm,
it's already is more than I ever wanted to do.
Why do I have to kill you?
Okay,
so then that nature to is not something Wing Chun feels complete.
They need knockdown killing power.
So the guan fits fits that missing link.
So they added it after Wong Wa Bo Liang Ni Tai Er.
Any questions on that?
History?
Thank you.
See hanging.
Yeah.
Okay,
and the nature of the guan,
it goes from thick to thinner all the way down.
That's why it's called mouse tail pull.
So it comes from a spear nature.
That's another thing that's important to note.
It's derived from a spear.
Because you've removed the spearhead.
That's the ideal type of hole you fit a spear into.
So you understand your weapons.
And also the grip,
the grip of the guan,
just like Ba Cham Do is where we should start.
As in golf,
it's all about the grip.
It's tennis about the grip.
Because you're holding a racket.
You have to learn the backhand,
the forehand,
the overhead.
So the grip changes based on the angle.
So with the guan,
you have to know the huan guan.
What is this grip?
Why is it preferred eyebrow?
See,
why closer to eyebrow?
Not up here.
And you see some movies,
they hold it up here.
Hey,
not that this is wrong.
This is where the dragon has to come in again.
If you have to protect your face,
don't be so proud that you have to put it over here.
You got to bring it over here.
See,
so the adjustments,
it
offers you this idea that you have to make up for the shortcomings.
So that's how you understand the Chinese culture.
They represent
all the Chinese culture using a dragon.
Because the number one is a long body,
long history,
has many scales,
literally.
So many different inputs from different monarchies,
different dynasties.
And it has five claw dragon.
There's a four claw dragon and there's a three claw dragon.
Now,
the five-claw dragon was meant for the emperor and anyone else who dare wear a
five-claw dragon would be executed.
That's how important it was to keep the five.
If the five elements must be in ruling,
no one else can have it.
So there's also the four call.
I'll take away.
This is for call recall.
Okay,
so then the as you go down into society,
you'll see a lot of three calls and four call dragons and some restaurants.
They have five call because there's no emperor anymore.
So you have you understand that that's important nature to that.
There's third different different calls for the dragon.
Okay,
so we can just jump into it.
Go over the form.
If no more questions.
You guys,
get the picture how it all ties together.
So neatly,
we all started with snake and crane.
And all sudden there appears to be a tiger and the leopard.
And by the way,
here's the leopard.
Right here.
That's the leopard.
It was it was a given away early on.
Every beginning of the form.
So don't think like,
oh,
I got found it in the bacham do know you from this.
Point on that.
You had the leopard.
And this part from Fuji.
You could call this the tiger.
You could call it the dragon.
Because this part that you know you from here,
you throw the heel of the palm with so much force at the fingers.
You don't want to see it.
They they close by themselves because the impact the power of the palm forces the fingers.
To close.
So that that part you see the dragon.
What a tiger.
Okay.
Of course,
you see this part is the crane.
And all we trying to stealthy.
They hide everything.
You don't see it as a crane.
Okay.
Okay.
So thank you all to who've contributed their videos.
And we're not interested.
I'm not interested in going through people's videos and making corrections.
Okay,
just just my observation.
Some people don't
view
the way it's meant to be built.
You want
now,
let's open this up.
Your knowledge of build one should be performed in what way?
Remember,
it's only six and a half moves.
It is not a complicated form.
So the build one must have if you could name them.
If you could go around the horn or one person could name all of it.
What does the build one?
Must have
to be performed correctly.
Energy
accuracy.
Well, that will require another object.
But yeah, eventually accuracy like the turn.
It must turn.
Excellent.
Laszlo.
Okay.
Gotta be straight for your videos.
You guys have done that.
You've shot seen power.
I've seen that some of you turn.
What else?
First remove you got arm arm fully extended.
The extended.
Yeah.
Let's straight on then the direction is straight up forward.
Correct.
Which is more more specifically on their shoulders.
Centerline.
Yeah.
About hiding the pole.
Correct.
And how you hide it Jake.
So people can see.
I need to own.
It is under the arm.
Correct.
Right.
Okay.
Anything else?
You step you step wider than you actually like you step wider than than the than the width that you that you end up having at the end.
So that you can also the one that also the one you started.
Right.
Right.
So the one you start
is called built a mock, which is from beauty.
This is the now you fit a pole here.
So beauty you could shift and check back, but you can also plant one leg and lift the heel of the other.
So it looks like this.
Then you stop the heel.
It is stopped.
So that's where we get stepping on people.
Don't think we don't have it.
We have it.
We have that stump.
You have to learn how to do your body mechanics so that not just your weight, but your game could break someone's toes.
That's in the event of someone attacking you from the back.
So this movement.
That's where you learn the deal time off.
That's what sets up the point.
John.
Now the videos I sent where I hold the pole one hand that's still time off stance.
I could hold it longer, but there's no point after 10 seconds.
So it's not my grip holding it.
I'm not death gripping it.
Now.
That's why we're getting back to the grip the grip.
What is the grip when I hold the one this way?
He was like my let go.
What is this grip called?
And you want to take a guess?
Yeah, teach on joy.
It's just the fist.
I don't know.
That's a guess.
Well,
more visible.
Okay.
So this grip, what's the script called?
Tiger mouth.
It definitely uses Tiger mouth.
Now, you guys have to understand my logic.
Why we have to show watch on dole first.
It's
it's basically like a jump, right?
It's like a neutral position.
And what is the jump called?
What is the definition of jump?
The rest resting pants, right?
It's the resting pole position.
That's the jump.
So that's why you could afford to rest.
So when you go to one John,
I'm resting, but my hands gone.
I'm resting the pole on my body right now.
And I'm resting it on my stance.
So it's a neutral position.
And it's near my navel again, which is the center of my body and also the wheelhouse of my power.
So because it's here.
This is what Christian was saying.
You must get low.
The fire.
You have to bring the body to the hand.
So the hand could do its job.
The view.
So all of you named build one and you're all correct.
But there's something missing.
And what's missing is also was not shown in the videos.
You said everything but one particular thing.
And it's that you guys don't stress.
The rear stance must move forward.
It's the rear stance.
That does the beauty.
So if you look at your videos again, not critiquing anyone.
If you find you don't move the rear stance.
You have no full view development.
A lot of you play like this.
So you're here.
This never moves.
This has to get into the game.
So there's a there's a name.
For that left leg.
The left leg has to drive the pole.
So all this time in our winch on you will learn to walk forward and then drag the rear leg.
Why would it stop here?
So dragging that rear leg is the bill power.
So look at your videos and you critique yourself and go out why I'm missing that.
I never even do that.
And not saying you weren't taught it, but somehow along the way, you just miss it.
You forget it.
Now, it's not that we don't build one from a still position.
You can but there has to be a condition but in the form all build one must be fired from the rear.
Just like a gun.
You pull the hammer.
You have to pull it back and then let it go.
It hits the bullet fires bullet.
So that little bit of snap the hammer of the gun.
That's what this leg is for.
You have to crash into it with the view.
So that's a very very important detail because we're covering it three times.
In fact, you're covering it seven times.
Because it's beer one view to view three time view hidden view for fuel lawn view seven times.
So if you don't do it seven times you did it seven times incorrectly.
That's how exponential it is.
Okay, so you have to really look at your form and go, how did I miss that.
How come I don't throw the rear leg into it.
Because we all said it your power.
So you have to look at just by looking at my form.
And if I do it like this.
I think the most dance.
You see, I could muster.
Some game.
Now watch the rear leg.
You could tell it's more than triple power.
Because the leg is stronger than the upper body.
So you had to learn to get the rear leg.
Coordinated synchronized with the one
and if you're not doing that
all six and a half points were mainly six.
If you include the long gone is seven is not its full potential.
Now, if you look at my diagram, you have to scroll way back and what's up.
It's different from sequels because I include the line one.
I have two parallel poles.
He doesn't have that.
So if you look at that diagram to him makes total sense, but to a student bill, where's the line one
So the line one is really
misunderstood too, but I'll get into that later possess.
That's at the end.
Okay, so let's look at
You understand the viewpoint.
Center line shoulder shoulder center line.
Maximize power must draw rear leg.
What else do we say the grip must turn
The pole must be hidden behind the arm.
So if I look straight
See my Phoenix eye.
I don't see any pole until after my index finger.
If I see the pole right here.
Like this.
I can see it and it's not under my arm.
It's not the more yacht.
Look the one
And why I say more yacht because other grandmasters
They play it where it's visible.
It's actually parallel to the farm not under the arm.
And we can get into that comparison to
As well as you've changed your joint.
It's also out.
It's available.
It's available to be seen.
It's not covered.
Okay.
Any questions so far?
Comments
Curious about the reason why this back leg step is absent
from all of our thinking like even when we play chiguan
Right?
It's it's and I wonder if that's where my mind goes, right?
Is because we learn the guan with the form last.
The first thing we learn is the exercises.
We do bubon, you know a million times and then we do chiguan
and I wonder why, you know, we don't do the the stepping with
the back leg and the best theory I have right now and I'm just
thinking through this, you know presently with you guys is maybe
it's just easier to maintain.
That distance like when we do the the setup with the zhongguan
and the heunguan to make sure that you know, we're both on center
line that it's easier to just try and return to that distance than
to have both people stepping and having these micro alterations of
the position between each each round of view, you know, so I wonder
if that's why we don't bother with the stepping initially.
It's that it's easier to practice these other dimensions of the pole.
Without having that step and then it's something that maybe just
gets it's, you know, extrapolated beyond its use.
That's my best theory about it so far.
That's great point Ryan.
So so let's go back back a step, right?
So we go back a step battle punches.
You see the rear, right?
So if I train it in the battle punches and I don't do it in the form.
Why do I do it?
The jinkun is the precursor to build one not look the important one
just the build one.
So is the blueprint to play build one?
So you do it in the battle punch.
That's why I purposely showed the battle punches because I do it in
the battle punches.
So one foot pulls and the other one has to catch up now talking about
the dragon pole.
Let's not call it six.
And the half-point pole right now use your imagination.
So if I use resistance bands on my ankles and I pull the front leg,
it's going to want to bring the rear leg pull the front leg pull the
rear leg.
But it's not in our training because they didn't have resistance bands
back then.
So if you put the resistance band on your ankle, you take a step.
It's going to remind you to pull the rear because you're pulling it so
much the next movement is going to yank the rear leg forward.
So there's another example of how you could take the modern way of
practice where you embed it in the mind or neuromuscular system.
You don't forget it.
So you have to customize that band of course, and if you want to start
with a lighter band, so you don't pull something.
But is it very important that you guys understand this distinction that
you all know the look of the build, but those details are missing.
Now, I'll get into why.
When is there a time that you don't move the rear and I also train
students here to do that.
They do build one drag the rear then they pause and they throw another
build one without moving the legs.
And that's for in case the person's attacking you.
The distance has gotten shorter.
So the build one from stillness is a defensive bugle.
It still will kill or at the very least.
Damage.
It won't be as powerful as dragging the rear.
But it's because it's something came in.
I don't have the room to even use the rear leg.
It's too close quarter.
So I better get my arm out and create some space before it could be
again.
It could be a shield, right?
We're always in the thinking that it could be just an attacking weapon.
So the shield if someone's rushing you you could you can have no time to
react.
You just throw the bill to keep the distance maintain the distance
because when the person passes the tip of the guan, you're in trouble.
You have to understand this is just like the gun folks.
If this barrel gets it's breached the barrel radius.
That even up close you're in trouble.
Right?
So what's great about a gun?
Keep the person at a distance that you're deadly at that's the whole
purpose of shooting at a range.
Hang on or a rifle.
You want to keep them at the kill distance that you already have expertise
in but you can't let someone get to the to the front or the side of the
barrel.
And if you do you're in trouble.
So the guan is the same thing.
That's it's it's darkness.
That's its weakness or the inside.
You see now you see Seagulls diagram and the diagram I posted the gaps
between each pole is yin.
Where you see the lines is yang.
So even the diagram has yin yang.
So from point build one time one from build a time.
There's a yang opportunity that you're vulnerable.
Then from yet from time all the way to here and go 50 degrees even more
vulnerability because not only did you did you pass you go 25 more degrees,
but you pass your center line.
I have to make a new center one.
So that's even a bigger opportunity for for failure.
Then from pin one to fuck one is another 25 degrees.
Now don't look at that as fixed either because if you do then you don't
understand the dragon nature.
The dragon doesn't limit you to 25 degrees.
Okay, that's just some starting point.
Why did they choose it?
It's probably because.
Because it's better to work at a narrower distance like this.
Now, if the jong is 180 degrees chum, Q is 180 degrees.
I'm those 180 degrees, but the John wants to narrow you down to almost 90
degrees.
Because they would look at it as the one is so long.
How are you going to be, you know, handling 180 degrees?
That's a lot to wield.
So they want you to get your shoulder in the center and understand
that you're going to have to do that.
So you have to learn to steer.
25 to the left, 25 to right.
Think of it as a big ship like the Titanic.
If you're if you're steering you're going 40 knots and there's an iceberg
25 degrees to the left.
You gotta move a big ass boat hysterical way.
Because the commitment of energy and mass is not going to be easy to
re-steer.
So this is why the one has a shorter shorter area of focus.
when you learn to be very agile you can of course turn 180 degrees and face someone else
but they want you to stay myopic for a reason okay we're clear on that you guys have all the
details for a good field one there's there's something else no one discussed what about the
rear hand we cover the pole all the way to the end correct but what what goes on with the rear
hand there's a rear hand engagement the rear hand is involved so we cover with the front hand front
arm what's the rear hand doing it's driving the pole forward yeah but using the beam the team
journal again if the dough was deemed around for view
right you see you can see a picture of the handle right here to view the guan is the same
team journal view this is what you're you're pushing the pole with this part so you see
these masters are really smart if they go this is an exchange oh you have also the center of the palm
and we have that already in the dough it wouldn't take much time for us to learn this guan
very similar in nature oh we already have a shoulder center line because our
from from our kung fu we already had a shoulder center line so oh perfect now we just got to add a
guan so you see that's two similarities already then all weapons have phoenix
oh we have that too so look phoenix right mando has this
one though so these masters are putting it together like okay
it won't take us long that's why it fits the nature of wing chun seagong and 89 at the white horse
pike school stated that too on the video you watch the video that it's he even makes the argument he
even goes as far as saying it's always been wing chun it's not something we added it's something
was easy to assimilate because they already had the winch on nature in it okay he he feels the
history was a no-brainer
so i'm giving you the details on naming a few pointers on how come it was so easy for
wing chun people to go yeah let's acquire that pole this is another story that wing chun married
into uh her husband leon bakto leon bakto had the one too that the guan came from him who taught
so it was almost like the marriage that needed again phoenix dragon
this recurring theme see but the storytelling makes it easier for you guys to remember the
kung fu now that it's it's all tied together it's not looking at it as a separate thing
so again the dim drill feel with the rear leg makes for a solid build one
now if you want to compare why are the other
styles don't go under the arm they end up Carmen
here
especially if you look at
Wang Shun Liu
v17
they're they're not like this that's why i call this the Mo Liadityao they're out here
and you don't believe me look up the videos you see all these guys have a non-concealed weapon you looks like here
can't seal
an eight-foot, nine-foot weapon anyway.
Well, if you can seal it under your arm,
wouldn't you get more of your,
it would have your body behind it,
and it would seem that if it's on the side,
you'd be using more of your own strength.
Don't forget why we,
don't forget why we cover the back of the guan,
because not just the power to push the guan,
but the feedback you get hit,
the guan come back and hit your body.
So inversely,
they don't want the guan to come back and hit their body,
but Grandmaster make sure we grab the,
cover the bottom so we don't come back and hit us.
And also the backhand does more of the carrying the weight of the guan.
I remember in my day,
Grandmaster come out,
give us some pointers and most people would stop,
but I freeze in the build guan position so he could correct my,
my,
my posture.
That taught me how to hold the guan.
It's not the,
the arm,
it's the backhand.
So then you,
otherwise this arm get worn out trying to hold the guan.
And the other,
the other,
the other reason he suggests the spiraling like throw a football or a bullet.
It keeps it on course,
the accuracy.
And then you could at the end of the build,
he said,
you should see more flower.
So if you put that energy under the arm,
you will see that.
If hold the guan outside,
outside,
the guan go more up and down.
So those,
those little things,
the others they're correct too.
I like when you say that's the way out squad,
because it's a nice way not to insult the others.
They are,
they have a lot of combat experience and,
and you,
they,
the others have shields and the guan could come back and hit your body very
easily.
So I think,
there are two reasons also to protect your body.
Absolutely.
And that's why when you measure out that you first thing is this
deemed your own first,
hold it under the arm.
The left is first.
If you think it's this way,
you don't understand the guan.
The guan must be,
this is why energy left goes out the right.
The left goes out the right.
The left goes out the right.
The left goes out the right.
The left goes out the right.
The left goes out the right.
So you want to think yin yang yin yang yin yang is the power side.
Take and the yin is to be accurate power and accuracy.
Yang yin the power is the left side.
That's why if you don't bring the leg or if you bring in the leg,
you bring in the body,
but you all starts with the hand.
You have to understand this part because the overall understanding
of all the kunkut we covered each,
almost each domain repeats that you must know yin yang.
So this part.
So remember guys,
the beginning of your trilogy,
the kung fu,
the body followed the hands,
the better your kung fu now the hands follow the body.
So where you learn this in this next stage of weapons.
So that's why my body anyway.
Very nice.
Okay.
Thanks.
So,
so the,
uh,
the guan zhong,
the neutral hand position.
It's just like,
but on those jumbo that,
that the starts and ends each time.
So,
so the,
uh,
the guan zhong,
the neutral hand position.
It's just like,
but on those jumbo that,
that the starts and ends each time.
So,
so the,
uh,
it starts and ends each section.
So the guan always goes,
reverts to the guan zhong position because it's the neutral position.
If you're a neutral also means you have to master relaxation.
So if you strike with the whole body with this hand close to the center of
your center of your gravity,
the navel area.
So it has to be the legs that drive it.
So Christian said,
you must squat.
Or lower your stance.
So let's get into that because that's the first three is first three is build one.
But number one must have guan zhong.
Guan zhong is like the zhong sa,
but gu po,
right?
So look at my hands,
one front,
one back,
both neutral,
both adopting this position,
jumps out,
but one in front,
one in back.
That's why I play the do,
one left,
one right.
I,
I change,
I shift because I mimic the hands,
right?
So now you do,
you're doing the long weapon,
the long weapon,
the hand,
the arm must be close to the body because the weapon's already long.
You don't need to extend your arm.
And once you extend your arm,
the skill we don't talk about is how to return.
That's a skill.
We're always eager to put the pole out there,
but how you return is predicated on the zhong,
zhong sa relaxation.
So when I tell you guys that you pick up a pole and you can't hold it with one hand,
most of you would death grip it to the point that you start to strain your neck too,
because then,
then you're using strength and muscle to hold something that doesn't require it.
You have to learn how to rest the guan on your body,
but via the contact grip of that zhong sa.
Okay.
Now,
the guan zhong down,
the biu is the next skill,
but don't think you skip over it.
Okay.
The diagram only has biu one,
biu two,
biu,
well,
the missing areas that is not on the diagram is guan zhong.
You must set up guan zhong.
And as I said earlier,
you have to have biu tai ma,
but there's no discussion of it.
See,
so all you do is you focus on six and a half points.
That's why I'd rather not call it that right now.
So the details,
the scales of the dragon,
every little detail matters.
How the input got to this point.
A dragon,
when pulled straight apart,
along,
taught,
is long,
is even longer.
So you have to think of the guan like that too,
that the arm,
the wrist,
the elbow,
the shoulder and the leg,
it's the dragon pulled,
pulled taught because the pull,
pull won't change.
Okay.
It's going to be a solid,
firm object,
but your body has to be the dragon.
It has to be able to extend
like a whip.
So there's a saying,
is a fierce,
which one's more fierce,
the head or the tail?
So when you look at the snake,
if a snake,
I'll use a rattlesnake,
because you see the rattle in the back,
right?
See the rattle?
So here's the rattle.
This is centering the snake.
It's the tail for the head to strike.
But if it doesn't know it's censored with the tail,
the snake loses its leverage.
It loses its bearings.
And there's some snakes that when bite,
when they bite you,
they use the tail.
If it's a boa constrictor,
for example,
they use the head and tail to subdue their prey.
So they're both equally dangerous and both equally deadly.
So if you look at this,
this could be the head of the dragon.
This side is the rear.
You have to look at it.
That's why I said don't make dragon male or female,
because it could be both.
Okay?
But let's say we stay on the context that the assumption is the dragon is the male.
Okay?
So this is the right hand.
Now is the dragon,
the head of the dragon.
So I need the tail to support the head.
But at this point,
they don't call it dragon tail.
There's a saying in Chinese,
dragon head,
phoenix tail.
I didn't make this up.
This is totally true.
Okay?
Long Tao Feng Mei.
You can ask Eddie.
If you go to play dominoes or Pai Gao in a casino,
they'll open up and say,
dragon head,
phoenix tail.
So they're connected again.
So
if I have this right hand as the dragon head,
the rear tail is the phoenix.
So you don't see it,
but the phoenix
is in sync
with the head.
So this is why we turn.
And remember,
this pole was taken away from a spear.
So the spear is not good enough to stick it into someone.
You want to tear up whatever it penetrates.
So this turn is to destroy more in the organs.
Here's a spear.
You see some of the spears,
they're not straight.
They're actually like a snake,
crooked.
So it scrapes and destroys more.
Okay?
So this is something I want you to understand that
number one,
guan zhong.
Guan zhong must be paired to shoulder centerline.
You must be relaxed.
So this stance.
So,
from here,
I used my body to hold the pole,
no hand.
So now I have to incorporate the phoenix side.
So phoenix side,
I'm relaxed.
My hand can rest by itself.
I don't need this other hand.
So this hand has a job.
It's not to hold the pole.
It's to drive the pole
to go forward.
So as I come down into the stance,
I drive it.
Now,
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to bend.
Then,
I can go.
Now,
why I have to say this,
because
at Sifu's Daiso Party in Holy Redeemer,
I asked the uncles,
can you do both?
Or which one should it be?
Should this arm be straight?
Because that's what I recall from Sikong's video
and being present at that seminar.
Or can it be,
should it be bent?
And Sifu Leo,
in all due respect to him,
he said you could do both,
which is the easy answer.
But he didn't explain
when you can do them.
Now,
I'll give you the details.
I was hoping for more people to say.
You got to understand for me,
I had to zip it.
I know it.
I can't say it
because it's grandmasters.
So you have to hope
someone's going to get there.
And I don't know what their apprehensions were.
Okay.
But they didn't get into the details of it.
So I'll explain it
because we're getting into Biu Guan.
When you are in Guan Zhong,
this elbow does not bend
because your body is erect.
The arm is hanging.
The Guan Zhong,
the pole is being held by this arm.
The elbow is locked.
So when you go to Biu Guan from here,
you don't go down,
bend the elbow and then go out.
That's incorrect.
Now,
when you can bend the elbow
is when you're already in Seiping Ma.
You have to bend the elbow.
It's ridiculous to hold the arm out.
So that's why I was saying to you,
you have to know the skill of returning the Guan.
So when you're in Guan Zhong,
you Biu Guan with the arm straight
because the legs drive this Guan.
Now here's the hinge.
The hinge is only my wrist.
Consider this elbow non-existent.
There's no joint here.
So the wrist is a hinge.
My shoulder is a hinge.
This elbow,
like put a sleeve,
like they call it some kind of a stint
when you break your arm.
So you put something here,
lock it in,
use Velcro.
You can't bend this arm.
So then when you Biu Guan,
it's the stance that builds.
Because again,
the wrist is the hinge,
so is the shoulder.
No elbow exists when you're standing.
But when you squat,
the elbows must bend.
That's why you saw how beautiful
Si Gong's stance was,
that the elbows have to bend
when you're squatting.
So that's the most important detail
you must start with.
Guan Zhong,
grip position,
one standing,
no elbow.
After Biu Guan,
you can Biu all day,
all night
when you're in a lower squatted stance.
You have to understand there's a difference.
So when someone goes,
oh, you could do both,
that's not even explaining it.
What's the detail?
When can you do
or should do
straight,
straight arm Biu Guan?
When should you do bent arm Biu Guan?
That's,
I just gave it to you.
You have to understand this guys,
if you don't train this way
with these details,
you're just going to go,
I got the Guan.
And I hear people say,
I got the Guan.
I learned the Do.
I'm complete.
I cracked up.
I thought,
you haven't even put five years in
to either one of them.
Now you got it.
See,
so you could call
the Zoom session,
the Cliff Notes.
Because so many people don't have it.
I'm not even saying
have the Kung Fu.
I'm talking about the precision,
the pristine knowledge,
the detail
that there's a point
you don't bend the arm.
There's a Biu Guan from the legs.
And there's a Biu Guan
from the upper body.
So how's upper body
is when you're ready
in the stance.
You guys clear?
You see how it's doable.
You see how it makes no sense
just to tell people
you can do both.
Because to me,
this is how I would interpret it.
I can do both.
See my shoulder?
Because now I think
I can do both.
I can do either one.
No, you can't.
When you do Guan Zhong,
this arm is straight.
Look at the parallel arms
of both my arms.
They're both parallel to each other.
And I started the talk.
This is a gate.
This is a gate.
So now,
I protect my gate.
How?
By you pointing my shoulder.
Not letting someone face me
this direction.
See?
So I protect the gate.
It's already understood.
Now,
I'll explain why those masters
have the Guan outside.
Out here.
It's really brilliant.
Okay?
Why they have it
on the side of their arm
parallel to their arm?
Because
this is the side
they have to protect.
Not this side.
See?
So it falls right into
the Lan one.
Now, how do I learn this?
I found this out.
I watched the people
who push the boats.
So when Bruce Lee entered a dragon
and that old man
is pushing him on the boat,
and you see his hands
very, very close
to his shoulders.
It almost looks like a flow.
And he's pushing the boat
on the low,
shallow water in the ground.
Just pushing it
or pushing it,
pushing it.
Because this is where
his strength must be.
Not here.
Not like this.
Push off a dock.
See?
Doesn't have to cover it.
Because this is the leverage
right here.
And his grip
can also be this way.
But that's pushing a boat.
So for it to be here,
you know why it's okay?
It's all right.
Because
they choose the pole
to be the act,
the aim,
the site,
not the shoulder.
And how I can make this
a valid argument
because
golfers do the same thing.
The ball
is about
three to four feet
in front of them.
And when they swing,
they don't aim
from the ball's perspective.
They aim from
their shoulder perspective.
Okay?
So when they go,
oh, I'm going to aim
four feet
in front of me
for the pin,
for the flag swing.
So they're hitting the ball
not aiming with the shoulder,
but parallel to the shoulder.
So the blonde
is the same thing.
Instead of my shoulder
being the aim,
it's the blonde
is the aim.
So my arm
has to support
the blonde.
This is why
it's also correct.
But it also gives them
this another,
I wouldn't say
it's an advantage.
But with the blonde
on this side
against this way,
it makes you
return
better.
Why?
I'm going to show
it to you.
Okay?
So if you build one,
the Moyad cover way,
right?
It's pretty good
at the center.
And if you build one,
it's a senior
bugger's way.
Okay?
So when you go
to jump,
the jump is
same thing.
It's the pole.
The pole is the aim.
Okay?
So wherever
I stick the pole,
that's where
I'm going to go.
But when I practice
Qigong's method,
I'm going to go
from the center
to the center.
Okay?
So the center
to Qigong's method,
I have to use
my shoulder.
See?
I'm aiming
from my shoulder.
And I don't really care
where the pole is.
Because as long
as it's understood,
the pole is straight.
If I aim properly
at my shoulder,
I'm going to hit
the targets.
I've done a lot
of target practice,
too.
So I try
from their perspective.
And it works
just as well.
Because now
my sight
has to be
left
of center,
left
of target.
Left of target.
Left of my shoulder.
Just left.
And it works.
Now,
here's where
they have
the advantage.
If their pole
is inside
the gate,
remember,
this is the gate.
There's the gate,
right?
So inside
the gate,
the inner gate,
when you
do,
when you
come back
to
Guanzhong,
or even
from the
build position,
and I want
to do Tan,
I have
that added
torque.
See,
until you
hit another
weapon,
it won't
make sense
to you.
It just looks
like a hand
position.
Like,
oh,
it's an option.
No,
it's not.
When you're
actually inside
this arm,
and I want
to do a
Tan Guan,
when I
turned
a little bit
of an extra
half a distance
turn,
it hits
the weapon
in almost
like the
vibration
is more
than that
person,
especially a
novice,
can handle.
Because you have
that little
bit more.
You see?
And it's
just like you
look at,
they fit
it to the
Ba Jiam Dou.
There's
Jiam Dou
this way.
Because
remember,
the Jiam Dou
is not
using
the
hand position.
So this
is also
just the
Guan.
The Guan
is all
that matters
to them.
Because they
don't look
at it
that it
has to be
the shoulder.
Does it
make sense?
Okay.
And if you
also see
it,
most of
those ones
I've
watched,
they do
this one,
they do
this one,
squat it
down.
There's
also a
very big
difference.
Now,
if they're
standing up,
this is
the other
grandmasters,
they build,
they step
forward,
they build.
So you could
see the
pole covers
my arm,
right?
Now,
some
energy is
coming
behind
my arm.
So as
you can
see,
my
shoulder
line is
on my
opponent.
Yes,
but my
aim is
left of
my
shoulder
line.
So I
actually
opened up
the
opponent
more
to
strike
him.
It
don't
think it
is as,
oh,
it's
a full
inch.
At this
range,
that's
like almost
six inches,
four to six
inches of
opening.
So if I
was the
other person
and all of a
sudden I
got this
time open,
my body
opened up
even more.
So when
they build
one,
that's
their
advantage.
They open
you a
bit more.
It's
the whole
side
of your
body
hitting.
So I
tried this
a lot,
and maybe
because I
didn't start
with it,
I don't
feel it to
be as
powerful
as the
one.
That's
my
comparison
for you
guys,
too.
You can
explore
it
yourself
and see
what you
can do
with it.
But if
you're
not
under the
armpit
like we
are,
this
type
of
skill
energy
is
really
tiring
on
your
arm
if you
are using
upper
body.
See,
and this
covering
the
scale.
So when
the
chin
is under
my arm,
look,
I don't
need this
on hand.
See,
I don't
need it.
It's
leveraged
under my
armpit
and my
arm is
holding
it up.
If I
do it
their
way,
uh-oh,
nothing
supports
it.
Now,
the pro
of this
being
parallel
to the
arm
is that
they have
that
little
bit
more
torque
in
opening
the
position
of an
opponent.
Okay?
So it's
a very
eye-opener
for me
anyway
by putting
in the
work
and again,
it's not
that they're
wrong,
but they
all measure
the same.
They measure
under the
armpit,
put the
arm,
but they
choose
the
one
using
the one
itself
as the
aim.
And we
use the
shoulder.
Now,
we use
the shoulder,
it's
obvious
that
the
arm
is
not
the
center
of
the
arm.
That's
why
the
shoulder
is
the
center
of
the
arm.
So,
the
shoulder
is
the
center
of
the
arm.
See?
You got to
know the
difference
from
elbow bent
and elbow
straight.
Explain
from
Guangzhong
to
Biu
Biu
Guang.
We
agree
to keep
the arm
absolutely
elbow
straight
locked.
You have
to become
the machine.
Explain
also
why
the
elbow
has to
be
locked
also.
So,
the
elbow
is
out
from
here,
it's
locked.
Explain
also
why
it
has to
be
also
locked
to
come
back
to
Guangzhong.
Oh,
you want me to explain that?
When you
Biu
Guang,
you don't
have to
squat all
the way
down.
Don't
follow the
form like,
you know,
be more
of a
dragon,
take the
risk,
explore
more,
okay?
So,
Guangzhong,
I don't
bend the
elbow,
it's
locked
because
the
elbow
is
locked
with
no
other
hand.
So,
because I'm
grooved,
I have
this ability
to hold
the pole
by itself
and with
this arm
without
this hand
too.
That's
why I prefer
under
the arm.
Now,
when
you
should
bend
the elbow
like this,
you can
bend the
elbow
like this.
You can
bend the
elbow
like this.
I'm
not
going
to
bend
the
elbow
like this.
I'm
going
to
bend
the
elbow
like this.
It's
not
a
good
thing to
have
to
bend
the
elbow
like this.
So,
you
can
bend
the
elbow
like this.
It's
not
easy
to
bend
the
elbow
like this.
It's
not
easy
to
bend
the
elbow
The balance, the weight, the scale, the guan is very heavy.
So you're correct.
You must understand the guan zhong.
But when we thrust it straight out, at some point, the guan is weightless.
So that moment is where you have to commit.
But before the guan starts to fall, that's your retraction.
So you use the weight of the zhong as coming back.
That's your recovery.
So you have to play with that kind of intensity.
If it just boom and come back, you never achieve the gong fu.
So you have to.
Feel the guan, the heaviness.
Use your leverage.
Thrust it.
It's no weight.
And then the arm is very important to keep straight.
That's why you become the machine.
Especially if they knock your bioguan down.
Then they're going to attack you.
If you don't know how to bring the arm back straight,
you can't recover the guan zhong.
The guan zhong stops their attack.
So just because you build, you also have to recover.
So in those days, it's very difficult to think about the elbow.
It's like lifting weights.
You don't know them.
You don't mean to cheat.
It's just that you have a success thing that makes you struggle.
But you lose.
You don't know how to perform.
So I used to use a towel.
I just keep it taut.
And then when I come back, I have to keep the towel taut.
If there's any bend in the towel, that's the bend of my elbow.
So that forced me to have a locked elbow.
So that's right.
Because we don't discuss a lot how to recover from the back to control the center line.
Especially when you're in the center line.
Especially when the other weapon hit your weapon.
You go pop and oh shit.
You're vulnerable at that moment.
So if you don't train, pop pop, pop pop.
You're missing the yin yang.
If it's down, it's got to be up.
If it's up, it's got to be down.
If I hit you high, I'm going to hit you low.
It's part of the kung fu.
So that's a lot of detail.
Also, to practice, you have to have a strong straight back.
Practice, guys, good form.
That's why we often say, you have to become the machine.
So every time you move, it's this precision.
So you have to develop.
I think that's all I have.
You cover everything, Vic.
Very nice.
Thanks, Sifu.
The diagram from Segal or from my polls, I used the toilet paper hole, the cover, toilet paper cylinder.
And I cut it one, two, three.
So you could interpret it any way you want.
Again, adopt the dragon thinking.
Okay?
Most people think it's just the same shot.
Same shot one, same shot two, same shot three.
So I'll give you an example of what I do.
I'm going to be on the screen.
So I'm right here.
You see the hole.
I can start with this first one straight parallel to the floor.
Go down, then I go up.
Go down, then I go down.
That's up to you.
If you want to open up the kung fu a little bit.
And make it a little bit more interesting than just same shot.
Now, here's also the diagram doesn't say.
It doesn't say you can't.
So it doesn't say you can.
It doesn't say you can't.
So I would side with the can't.
It didn't say I can't do it.
So I'm going to do it.
So the way I play the first three.
I also don't limit myself.
I get rid of the pole.
Okay?
So I don't limit myself to this.
And drag the rear.
Drag the rear.
Right?
I also.
I interpret it as.
If you.
Bring the guan zhong forward.
If you.
Bring the guan zhong forward.
Now I'm out of the frame.
So instead of it always being go out, come back.
I can go forward.
There's no rule that says that guan zhong can't go forward.
And if you were ever in a battlefield.
You're going to find that you're going to go away.
That guy's not coming towards me.
So why am I always going forward and going backward?
So I have to go out to my opponent.
So I have to, you know, attack him.
So if you limit your guan zhong to only going back and resting.
No, you have to go forward and rest.
See?
So that those three dots.
They're better that they're so limited in dimension.
There's less rules.
Like a constitution.
It's better when there's less.
In there.
Right.
That means it's profound written material.
But you go to all these little details explaining everything.
And suddenly it's not profound.
So the diagram.
Three shots.
So if you're used to the first one was just same shot.
Same shot.
Same shot.
Okay, fine.
Maybe that's exhausting after a year.
So open your mind.
Up mid low.
Walk in three times.
Don't play it.
So stagnant.
You're not in Hong Kong in a triangular floor space.
We have a lot of space.
You could go outside.
Open up the kung fu more.
Okay.
Now that covered three.
But that's already only three and a half left.
See?
This will go quick.
But I need you to understand about how the guan returns.
It's really important.
Now getting back to the scale.
So the old scale would be.
A string.
This is a way larger.
Scale.
But if you imagine this like.
Maybe.
A 50th.
The size.
The rope would be right here.
And then it would be hanging at this pivotal point.
All the way over here.
So at the end of this tip.
They would hang.
Like a dish.
Then you put the, put the herbs or whatever you want to put on here.
And then this part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
This part.
Where the strings holding there's a way.
So based on the weight, let's say the weight is.
Five.
Five kilograms or two kilograms.
You measure the goods on that.
Once it's balanced.
That's two kilograms or one.
So why did they use the chain to represent?
The guan.
Is because.
You're not going to use all the guan by grip.
This.
my hand grip is this is where the string would be so when i held the one with one hand on the string
right now and the heaviest part of the one is the back this is thicker so i'm also using
kung fu to bring the long part up so what the seagull meant with the chain is that that tool
is what you have to get in your mind that you're trying to be that tool and if someone knocks your
one down it's up to you to rebalance that one from the front hand grip this is supports again
why this can't be bent when standing see look if i bend it when i'm standing look look at my shoulder
i'm cheating see i'm bending it i'm keeping it tight against my rib cage to try to hold the one
and a lot of people because they're actually doing it on their own
effort they'll try to hold the one with one hand because it looks cool so they'll cheat they'll
find a way to use their body so they can hold it but if the whole arm is resting on me my my rib
cage obliques my hip and more importantly my lap and then i hold it this is why it's held by itself
don't need the left hand so you're trying to be a human scale
and it's all
based on the grip again that's why the grip is so important now if it's a scale the scale has to be
neutral the weight on the left weight on the right if the scale is biased you rip off the people
you're selling to because they do that they put a weight that says one kilogram but it's half
that's how they cheat people in the old days but these tools are so cheap to make that they bring
it in the stores and sell there's a testimonial or a card like that with Figure 5
I don't remember probably having that i'm just saying
that that weight why sikong included in the illustration
is that you must be your own scale or you could say your own balance
interview with Karate Kid
karate has it filter I don't remember Karate Kid having that but I'm just saying that debate why sikong included in the illustration is that you must be your own scale or we could say your own balance you have to figure this out and again in new york when sikung said if you can't hold soon like a chang you're not reserved even if he did Larry rural to Hanoi.
if you not able to carry it then you
you're not ready for it and i could tell you if you went around and said everybody pick it up one
hand and hold it you're gonna go oh geez maybe he's right see because the one in new york is
really heavy but somehow i don't know how i was able to hold it i i never trained for it no one
told me the secret or anything like that i go really let me try yeah the ones in new york
were i i've never seen ever jones like uh guans like that ever ever since they were just huge
yeah and it's true because i witnessed myself uh grandmaster moya hold the those guans with one hand
and um so he found the the center he was able to find it so you guys have to find it now you do
need a good grip
yeah so if you have a weak wrist a couple broke up fingers it's going to be difficult but you can
find it you know right and keep in mind that string that holds the chopstick that i sent a
picture of this is the arm that has to be pulled down by the pole it can't be bent while standing
now the only time you could bend it while standing we're going to get into
it's intentional look mike i i wouldn't want to say mastered the resting pole but say i'm beyond
the resting pole now so the next movement is tan guan and tan guan is also what requires both my
hands i've been moving together like windshield wiper upside down windshield wiper right so they
come up wrist above elbow stop grip turn clockwise
until cannot go anymore you see the phoenix eye folks right it's right there now i have a tan guan
so i have to follow my shoulder line going back to moyak one then i while dragging the rear leg
okay then i come back now that's the option when we first start is return to guan zhong i don't do
that anymore
i after the buguan i come up to guan zhong because i still want to be an attack move
i'm going after the guy i want to finish off i don't come back so this is the detail
so guan zhong arm resting like that string holding the scale
come up keep turning you cannot turn anymore and then you have to go the opposite direction
of where you started so tan open view other way you get clap wise counterclockwise yin yang again
okay that's the tan guan okay any any questions on that
time one because i'll tell you this people play like this watch watch the wrist never comes up
past the elbow see it it's called a lazy time going
see you have to lift it then keep turning now you can tell by my knuckles that it's above my elbow
then i'd be dragging the rear okay if you're not doing that you're not really playing time going
now here's the dragon part again it's not written in stone if i choose to do tanguan
but that person suddenly went low like a fencing chinese
fencing blade they cut off my ankle right so i went to do the time the the sword as i'm trying
to do it he changed so then i have to adopt the hyun guan to cover myself the lower half that's
why tan follows with hyun then you go to full because we account for up yang low yin then up yang again you see it's repeated
folks it's like i don't make it up why not tan first foot first because it's just a sequence
right who cares why does that have to go tan goes up hearing goes down and focus back up
it's intentional see so you want to cover your bases but what i'm saying is you've got to do
the time one something happened so i could be in the process of trying to do tanguan
but here you have tan 1920 two he tenho Immer ultrasound so those are very?)
con tu izóniu
there i got what's it going to be
satake
yon
ering
you got quality food coming in dida smesu you start practice you down exatamente performance go point two three for turn he may be stupid so i'm trying to do tan guan and the gun went to go low I bew low knock him out and you know why i practice the bew low just like i showed you don't just do a stagnant one two three train your ranges because the jama has it upper middle low the gu plastica weren quote has the upper middle low the one can't be one dimensional just shoulder just shoulder with promises you have to have these abilities when you get injured femmes and you're not practicing you can have these children you need to sa tspere franceses you have to have these abilities that you have to have an
and up, mid and low.
So I wouldn't adopt
If I'm middle of trying to tan the sword
and then he changed and then boom,
build low, kill the guy.
Okay, don't look to do tan and go,
oh, good thing I have hun.
Then you misunderstand.
Because tan leads to build, hun leads to build,
fuk leads to build, that's why you do build seven times.
See, so don't go like, oh, after tan something happens,
I gotta do one of the other two options I have left.
If you include lan guan, you have three other options.
But you don't.
See, you're over-complicating it.
Okay, so now, hun.
Hun guan.
So from guan zhong, hun.
And the grip changed.
Because first, this grip was
in a resting position.
Now, it's not in a resting position.
It's in a defensive position.
Why I say defensive?
You have to assume heavy contact
on the bottom end of this pole.
So if you grip, your fingers are not protecting,
protecting the direction of the pole
is gonna bounce off this way.
See, if someone hits this pole,
it's gonna come hit me in the head.
So my grip has to be my fingers.
Why the fingers, not the palm?
Because the fingers can perpetually adjust.
Ask any musician, Mustafa.
You know the fingers is what makes the music.
It has that dexterity.
So if the fingers are pointing towards you,
you could base it on what you feel
and you make the adjustments.
So if you do the palm, it also creates fei zhang,
my elbow.
exposed here. But bring the elbow down. That's why you see how beautiful Si Gong is. He's
down. His elbows are sinking down as well. He's still doing Mai Zhang. So this is here.
The fingers protect this potential. If it goes that way, you could care less. You don't
want this to hit you in the head. That's why you have to grip it with the fingers. We just
covered Tan. Huynh. After Huynh, Biu Guan. Again, dragging the rear because it's important
that you play Biu Guan correctly. Now Huynh Guan. After Huynh Guan, Wan Zhang. Huynh Guan,
Biu Guan. Wan Zhang, Ho Chung. Wrist comes up. Turn counterclockwise so it can turn no
more. Now turn to this position.
so you can see what I just did to my foot, my foot one.
Look at my index fingers.
They are already, when I build,
I'll put the guard down, I'll come back up.
They're already pointed in this position.
That's why it's foot one.
It's the simplest build.
Once again, supporting why foot one, foot south, is superior.
It requires the least amount of movement to become a build one
because it's already in position.
Now you have to focus on that rear leg,
penetrate that person's game.
Okay, so we covered build one, build two, build three,
and pan, hyun, fo.
Okay?
Now run one.
So after fo, build,
wanzo,
return to center,
squat down,
from squat down.
From here, I have to build.
I can't come back here and then build.
I have to build from here
and drag the rear leg.
So this is where I think the grandmasters that are not single,
they get this outside hold from
because the line one.
It's all about the line one.
Here,
they use the pull, the arm, I'm sorry,
the arm as the stopper.
We don't do that.
Line one, build under the arm.
There's nothing to put the brakes on.
So you know how we hit the arm here?
We do build one.
Oh, that's another point missed about build one.
You weren't hitting the arm.
So that means you're not throwing your full capacity.
But this part here, line one,
build one.
You hear that slap?
You hear the slap, right?
It's this way
for those other lineages.
So they have it too,
but it's not under.
It's this way.
But theirs makes more sense to me
because from line one,
this is a given.
We know this from beauty.
But to have the arm be where it's supposed to be,
the shoulder, stop the pull.
So that's all the detail, line one.
Then last part.
Repeat.
Line one, drag the rear leg, build.
Return, follow the sternum down, tap one.
Half point, where Sikong was left off.
He was just about to do it in that picture.
And this part, if you didn't take the elbows back seriously,
elbows parallel to the floor seriously,
,
even the jaw, this won't appear.
And I want you to understand,
this elbow does not come up this way.
Does not come up, like, seriously.
High up, covering the chest area.
This one comes closer to the hip.
Because the Guan is the Yang style.
So when I was skating around in that park,
by the bridge, and I did this Kung Fu,
my grandfather's Hong Kong, the punches, right?
This low stance is a hard style.
And it's a more masculine style.
It's a more masculine style.
It's a more masculine style.
That's why it's wide open.
So the fists protect the genitals, the crown droops.
Up here is more feminine, protects the breasts.
So you have to understand the Yin and the Yang too.
So when this comes down,
it should come down close to the hip.
Because otherwise you won't come all the way down.
See, if you might come at the top, up here.
Now watch this one.
Now you'll see all the problems.
All the pole rub against my chest and my abs.
I just covered the whole thing.
So next week will be seven minutes over,
will be some drills, some other little details,
how to practice, how to practice with partners in sync,
how to be accurate with targets.
I do it all here.
It's like amusement park.
You just set all this stuff up.
You gotta practice, you know?
And you can compete with your Kung Fu brother or sister.
Hey, I knocked down more.
You gotta pick them up.
Whoever knocks down more does not have to pick them up.
Right?
That's how you make them motivated.
Like, I don't wanna be the guy who always pick up the balls.
Right?
So that's another way to compete,
get people excited to train.
So I covered it.
Six and a half points.
You guys don't have any questions,
then we continue next week.
Very nice, Vic.
The tang guan, the elbow bends for the first time there.
But the reason he can make the exact same movement every time
and not get fatigued is because like a compass,
he used the elbow.
So that's not in a lot of other families.
They do, the elbow is out.
There's nothing that connected to the body.
So also he does the same with the hin.
So the tang and hin,
they're the same angle will be precision
because he used the elbow.
So I hope you guys pay attention.
For me, when I play long guan,
I practiced a lot in a circular movement with the long guan.
This became too arduous.
Just here and then here, you know.
But in practice, the fighting of the guan,
this movement became more effective.
Not just stop here and then go here.
It's using the momentum like this.
Long guan also is, long guan, guys, could be a very powerful hit.
Especially when they put their body behind it this way.
They hit you with their guan, long guan.
So that's one of the things you have to defend if we look at next week.
Long guan, not just the bill.
Good.
Thank you.
Any questions, guys?
Don't be shy.
Okay.
There's a lot of detail,
but at least I started with the detail.
You know, something else about the full guan.
Because the guan is so heavy,
you guys might be concerned about the grip
because it's very subtle.
From hin, you turn all the way over
and you hold the guan like this.
It's very delicate.
But you have to remember, you'll be resting on their weapon.
So you don't need a lot of grip because you're on their weapon.
So don't be too concerned.
Try to get a grip this way.
No.
Just a turn.
You already cover, rest on their weapon.
Real quick.
I just sent to WhatsApp two videos.
One is one second.
And it's called...
And it's called the kum move.
Kum is to cover.
Like a lid over a pot.
So the full guan is like a kum.
It's like a lid on a pot or on a pan.
Okay?
And the second video is to show you what Chris and I did yesterday.
If you see the maces, you have to strike between the maces.
So you have a target.
And we have to be in sync.
Or the look bing bong guan doesn't look right.
And we try to do one sound.
So if you see that, that's dragon imagination.
You could do the same thing but make it more fun.
Make it more challenging.
And the mace, you see the gap between Christians?
I had to widen it because he was constantly knocking it down.
But generally, you want to tighten the two balls at the bottom.
So it is really narrow.
But even by sound, we're learning from sound.
If you hear the sound, you're going to get better quicker because you have another sense involved in your perfection.
Not just visual.
Hearing.
Vibration.
Feeling it come back to the pole to your hand.
That's how you get quicker.
Get better quicker.
The more senses you can enroll in your improvement speeds up the process.
So this is just to give you guys some idea.
He's very tall.
He's like 6'4".
So, you know, he's got me by a lot.
But I have to synchronize with him.
Because his durian guan takes longer to come down.
So I have to slow it down to be in sync with him.
But what becomes of it is not are we not closing in.
Not are we not close as two human beings.
But our training gets closer.
Like more feel.
More understanding.
That's why you've got to spend more time with your Sifu, Siheng.
You have to train more so you have this biorhythm in place together.
See?
But if you don't have the same goal, you're not going to get anywhere.
Guys, I'm telling you.
You're going to just train.
I'm going to do my thing.
You do your thing.
I have nothing to do with you.
Where did that happen?
I was all about cooperation.
Suddenly you learn the weapons.
You don't want to practice anymore.
It makes no sense.
You have to figure out how to practice with a Sida or a Simoy or a Siheng, Sijie.
You have to figure that out.
You have to work that out.
That's the part most people don't like.
Because they want to be free.
You've got to put in the time.
You've got to do this stuff.
So later I'll include the bloopers.
It took like four shots to get that one.
The other ones.
.
Oh, yeah.
He looks so clumsy.
We're like two clowns in an amusement park.
You know?
But that's how you get started.
You have to set some standard.
After that, he and I go, okay, next Saturday, are you good?
I'm good.
We're going to do better than last week, right?
Yeah, see?
That's how you work.
Okay?
This is how you have fun.
And you've got to remember, forget the fact that these are outdated weapons.
If you want to help your kung fu school and you want to go out there and demo, that's
impressive demo.
two people, three people, four people, six people,
eight people in sync,
that's a sign me up.
Where do I sign up?
Where do I get to join the school?
Because I've never seen anything like that before, right?
So you have to show off the Kung Fu.
There's a time to be modest,
but not when you're marketing,
not when you're trying to grow your school.
You need to show the Kung Fu, okay?
Good night, everyone.
Nice, guys.
Thanks, people.
Thanks, everybody.
Good night, everyone.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Good night, Shifu.
Thank you so much.
Good night, guys.
Good night.
Good night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
It was great.
Welcome.
Hope you all have a happy holiday.
Take care.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to everyone.
Okay.
Merry Christmas to everyone.
Bye.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye.
