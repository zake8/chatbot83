	* Correction: No RAG text provided. Retrieval Augmented GenerativeAI text needs to be provided.
2. The acronym "RAG" should be spelled out as "Retrieval Augmented GenerativeAI" at the first occurrence, followed by the acronym in parentheses.
	* Original: No RAG text provided. Retreival Augmented GenerativeAI text needs to be provided.
	* Correction: No Retrieval Augmented GenerativeAI (RAG) text provided. Retrieval Augmented GenerativeAI text needs to be provided.
3. The spoken number "8" in "ChatBot8" should be transformed into its numeric representation.
	* Original: metadata={'source': 'ChatBot8/nothing.txt'}
