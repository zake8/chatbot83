Vulnerabilities
Note: the device may not be impacted by all of these issues. The vulnerabilities are
implied based on the software and version.
CVE-����-�����When a HTTP/� stream was reset
(RST frame) by a client, there was a
time window were the request's
memory resources were not
reclaimed immediately. Instead,
de-allocation was deferred to
connection close. A client could
send new requests and resets,
keeping the connection busy and
open and causing the memory
footprint to keep on growing. On
connection close, all resources
were reclaimed, but the process
might run out of memory before
that. This was found by the
reporter during testing
of CVE-����-����� (HTTP/�

Conﬁgurations are aﬀected when
mod_proxy is enabled along with
some form of RewriteRule or
ProxyPassMatch in which a non-
speciﬁc pattern matches some
portion of the user-supplied
request-target (URL) data and is
then re-inserted into the proxied
request-target using variable
substitution. For example,
something like: RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http:/ /
example.com:����/elsewhere?
$�"; [P] ProxyPassReverse /here/
http:/ /example.com:����/
Request splitting/smuggling could
result in bypass of access controls
in the proxy server, proxying
unintended URLs to existing origin
servers, and cache poisoning.

update to at least version �.�.�� of
Apache HTTP Server.
