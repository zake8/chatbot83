<summary>
An extraterrestrial entity, with the ability to assimilate and mimic other lifeforms, recounts its struggle for survival in a science fiction narrative. Crash-landing in Antarctica, the entity confronts communication barriers and hostility from human researchers. Musing on its past as a missionary and soldier, spreading life throughout the universe, it now finds itself hunted and misunderstood. The text delves into themes of communication, identity, and survival, with a focus on the entity's introspection. Jargon includes biological terms and concepts related to the entity's mission. The intended audience: sci-fi fans interested in existential and philosophical themes.
